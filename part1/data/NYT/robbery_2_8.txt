The court set a deadline of next Tuesday for the submission of a report into an inquiry ordered by Prime Minister Imran Khan, and directed that the girls not return to Sindh until the case was resolved, broadcaster Geo Television said.Police have detained ten people in the case over their marriages and registered a formal case of kidnapping and robbery by the teenagers, after complaints from their parents.The incident prompted a rare public intervention by a top Indian official in its neighbor's domestic affairs, when Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj said on Twitter she had asked India's ambassador in Pakistan for a report on news of it.Pakistan was "totally behind the girls", Information and Broadcasting Minister Fawad Chaudhry said on social media in response to Swaraj's Sunday message, but asked India to look after its own minority Muslims.
