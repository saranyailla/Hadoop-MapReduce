Tarrant, that the person he was said to have killed should temporarily not be publicly identified to avoid causing harm to the person’s family.The police said they had apologized to the person they named in error, but they did not respond to requests for further details.The mistake was uncovered when reporters noticed a discrepancy between the police’s official list of names, which was released on Thursday, and the names identified by victims and other sources. Radio New Zealand, which first reported the police’s mistake, counted 51 names when the police insisted that there were 50.Mr. Eaton said it was embarrassing but perhaps understandable for a police force overwhelmed by a crime like nothing it had ever seen.“When you’re dealing with something for which there is no established response, which you’ve never experienced before, then things are going to be thrown up that you’re going to have to learn from,” he said. “There are mistakes made and learnings for sure.”Advertisement
