The Cuban embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told a regular news conference on Monday that officials were still looking for 22 people, thought to be migrants, who were kidnapped by armed men from a bus in early March in Tamaulipas. Violent clashes among criminal gangs in the state have led to high rates of murders and disappearances for years. Lopez Obrador also said that Mexico is making progress in reaching an agreement with the United States on investment in Central America and Mexico to reduce migration.The United States will commit billions of dollars toward development in the region as part of a plan to strengthen local economies and discourage migration, officials said in December.
