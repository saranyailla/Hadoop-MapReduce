Jeremy Richman, 49, was the father of 6-year-old Avielle Richman, who was among 20 children and six teachers killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre.Imagine the daily anguish and torture of the parents of those 20 murdered children. Passing empty bedrooms, some probably still full of the clothes of their slain child. Imagine the depths of misery when birthdays come and go, and when there are empty chairs at family gatherings like Thanksgiving, and the absence of presents under the tree at Christmas. Then we have two suicides of student survivors of the Parkland shooting to add to the carnage. I’m fed up with “moments of silence” by Congress, the candlelight vigils and masses of flowers. We need a leader and a government like New Zealand’s. Instead, we have a Congress bought and paid for by the National Rifle Association and gun manufacturers, and a citizenship with no power to halt the daily gun killings.We hear the word “Enough!” uttered so often by so many. The result? Nothing is done. It’s obvious to me that Mr. Richman couldn’t stand the pain any longer. Let us all hope and pray for no more suicides caused by despair and misery.Michael GoldingFort Myers, Fla.Advertisement
