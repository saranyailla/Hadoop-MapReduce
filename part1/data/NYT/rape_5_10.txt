Prosecutors a day earlier had said they believe Tanis had a radicalized ideology and that there was no evidence of any relationship between him and the victims.Tanis, who has been convicted of illegal weapons possession, shop lifting and burglary in recent years and has to appear in court on rape charges in July, is believed to have acted alone.Prime Minister Mark Rutte is expected to join a march through Utrecht on Friday evening, commemorating the 19-year old woman and the 28-year old and 49-year old men who were shot dead in the attack.The Utrecht District Court said the judge had ruled that Tanis should be permitted to communicate only with a lawyer.
