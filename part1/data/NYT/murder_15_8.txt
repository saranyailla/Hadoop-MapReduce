In addition to the 50 killed, dozens of people were wounded at two mosques in the South Island city during Friday prayers.Peters said he had to put aside his personal shock and sadness and to do his job."Quite shocked and sad by what had happened, but in dealing with this fellow, I had to put that to one side and just deal with what's before me," he said.
