They say the nature of the shooting and a note found in a getaway car led to strong suspicions of an extremist motive.The team investigating the shooting has asked a forensic psychiatry and psychology institute to carry out a personality test on the suspect.At Friday's behind-closed-doors hearing, an investigating judge extended Tanis' detention by two weeks so that investigations can continue. In a statement, the court said the judge ruled that "the suspicion is strong enough to detain the man for longer."A 40-year-old man who was detained a day after the shooting because Tanis was arrested at his home has been released without charge after no evidence was found that he had helped Tanis in the shooting, prosecutors said.Utrecht Mayor Jan van Zanen said at the start of the evening's silent procession that one of the three seriously injured victims was improving, "the other two, sadly, not yet."Virgil van Dijk, captain of the Netherlands' soccer team, which was staying near Utrecht to prepare for a match Sunday night, tweeted: "Although we are not walking with you this evening, 10 kilometers away we are standing still for the terrible events of Monday."Several people carried a long red banner emblazoned with white letters spelling out, in Dutch, "Utrecht never bows."___Corder reported from The Hague, Netherlands.Advertisement
