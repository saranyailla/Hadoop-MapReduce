Waters said medical examiners with the Sacramento County Coroner's office would determine the cause of death. She did not provide any further information. In May 2017 Goh pleaded no contest to murder charges stemming from the massacre at Oikos University in Oakland. He was sentenced in July of that year to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Prosecutors say Goh, who dropped out of the university in 2011, was angry at administrators at the school when he opened fire there on April 2, 2012, killing seven people.Goh was initially found mentally incompetent to stand trial after doctors determined that he suffered from paranoid schizophrenia. A Presbyterian minister from South Korea founded Oikos University as a vocational school in 2004.  (Reporting by Dan Whitcomb in Los Angeles; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)Advertisement
