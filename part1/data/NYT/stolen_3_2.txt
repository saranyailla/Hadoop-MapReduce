The agreement, per ESPN, tacks on 10 years to the final two seasons remaining on Trout's $144.5 million agreement with the Angels.The deal would smash the massive contract signed by Bryce Harper -- 13 years, $330 million with the Philadelphia Phillies -- on March 2.Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Zack Greinke had the MLB record annual average salary at $34.4 million. Trout would eclipse that mark with $36 million AAV.Boxer Canelo Alvarez signed a contract with DAZN worth a minimum of $365 million.Trout has a staggering 64.3 Wins Above Replacement through his age-26 season, which is far beyond any player at his age in Major League Baseball history.The 24th pick in the 2009 amateur draft, Trout has made the playoffs only once with the Angels in eight seasons.
