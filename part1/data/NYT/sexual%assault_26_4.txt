Biden has been taking steps to assemble a political team in early-voting states such as Iowa and South Carolina.In the article published Friday, Flores wrote that she and Biden were waiting to take the stage during a rally in Las Vegas before the 2014 election."I felt two hands on my shoulders. I froze. 'Why is the vice president of the United States touching me?'" Flores wrote. "He proceeded to plant a big slow kiss on the back of my head."Flores said Biden's behavior "made me feel uneasy, gross, and confused," adding, "Even if his behavior wasn't violent or sexual, it was demeaning and disrespectful."Biden spokesman Bill Russo said in a statement Friday, "Neither then, nor in the years since, did he or the staff with him at the time have an inkling that Ms. Flores had been at any time uncomfortable, nor do they recall what she describes."Russo said Biden "believes Ms. Flores has every right to share her own recollection and reflections, and that it's a change for the better in our society that she has the opportunity to do so."Advertisement
