"During this period, Formula One has consistently ignored the abuses that occur," she added.The Bahrain authorities have said Yusuf's conviction was unrelated to the grand prix."Najah Yusuf's defence did not claim during her trial that her right to free speech had been infringed," they said in a statement this month when the same rights groups wrote to Formula One expressing concern."Peaceful protests of any kind are protected by Bahrain’s constitution and do not constitute a crime."British peer Lord Scriven, who has discussed the situation with Formula One's general counsel Sacha Woodward-Hill, told reporters at the HRW offices that the sport must show it did not operate in a 'moral vacuum'.He said the meeting with Woodward-Hill left him with some optimism, and Formula One had committed to a full independent investigation into the case, but 'warm words are not enough'. Scriven said that if Bahrain refused to grant access to Yusuf, that would be grounds to cancel the race."Even at this last minute, they have to take decisive actions," he said. "I think this is a litmus test for F1 leadership."Scriven said that otherwise the rights groups would have to 'turbocharge' the campaign and try to engage the likes of Mercedes' five-times world champion Lewis Hamilton."If Sacha Woodward-Hill and the leadership don't show they are serious, then it's down to drivers and sponsors to actually take that moral, ethical and legal step to say 'we will not drive and we will not participate'," he said.
