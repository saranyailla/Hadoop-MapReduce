It was held on a stage that had been set up for a concert by Canadian singer Bryan Adams that was cancelled after the attacks.The names of each of the 50 people killed were read out.Okirano Tilaia, the head boy at Cashmere High School, which lost two students in the attack, cited Martin Luther King Jr. in his speech, saying he conquered people with love, peace and solidarity."Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can," Tilaia said. "And hatred cannot drive out hatred. Only love can."New Zealand has been holding a series of memorials since the attacks. On Friday, people across the nation observed the Muslim call to prayer one week after the attacks. Next Friday, a national remembrance is scheduled.Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, has been charged with murder in the attacks and is scheduled to make his next court appearance on April 5.Advertisement
