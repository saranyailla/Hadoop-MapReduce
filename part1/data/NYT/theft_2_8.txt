"Is it because the soda made you do it?"Montilliano spent seven days in jail following his arrest. During that time, he learned the importance of complying with the law, defense attorney Josh James said in court."I'm not going to steal cars anymore," Montilliano told the judge. "I don't want to be in jail no more."Loo also sentenced Montilliano to 100 hours of community service and a $100 fine.He had pleaded no contest to charges of unauthorized control of a propelled vehicle and driving without a license.___This story has been corrected to show that the judge suggested the man not drink Pepsi, but did not order it as part of his probation.___Information from: The Maui News, http://www.mauinews.comAdvertisement
