I guess taking it one series at a time -- it's a bit of a clich??, but that's how it is."Australia won the 2015 World Cup on home soil without a specialist slow bowler but wrist-spinners have become a must-have in 50-over cricket and occupy half of the top-10 bowlers in the ICC world rankings for the format.Zampa, who relies less on sharp turn and drift and more on attacking the stumps with deliveries that skid off the pitch, bowled well in tandem with offspinner Nathan Lyon in India.The pair are expected to continue their dual spin assault against Pakistan in the five matches in the United Arab Emirates. The first match starts on Friday in Sharjah."We can't bury our heads in the sand and just say we're going with fast bowlers when spinners in world cricket, and in one-day cricket in particular, are being very, very successful," selector Trevor Hohns said earlier this week.Batting team mate Shaun Marsh felt Zampa had improved "out of sight" in the leadup to the May 30-July 14 World Cup."It???s just his control now, he???s a bit more mature," he said."He???s got a bit more of an understanding of what he???s trying to do out there."I thought he did a fantastic job in all the games (in India) and he took wickets at key times. He???s going to be a big part of this team moving forward." (Reporting by Ian Ransom; Editing by Peter Rutherford)Advertisement
