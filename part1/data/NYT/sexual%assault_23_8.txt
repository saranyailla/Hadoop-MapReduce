Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today._____________________• A new fight over the Affordable Care Act broke out on Tuesday, as Democrats denounced the Trump administration for asking a federal appeals court to invalidate it. The surprise decision, which could leave 21 million people without health insurance if the court agrees, gave Democrats a chance to move past impeachment and discuss kitchen-table issues like health care.• The most enduring legacy of Robert S. Mueller’s investigation may be his decision not to take action on President Trump’s norm-shattering interventions in the law enforcement system. Future presidents may feel entitled to take similar actions.• As the Trump administration celebrates Mr. Mueller’s finding that the president did not conspire with Russia, a darker theme is emerging: a message that Mr. Trump’s perceived enemies will pay.• Scientists at the Interior Department spent years examining the threat that pesticides present to hundreds of endangered species. That work was pushed aside after David Bernhardt, now President Trump’s nominee to lead the department, intervened.• Senator Kamala Harris of California announced her campaign’s first policy rollout: a plan to heavily invest federal money in teacher pay.• A donor database assembled by Ms. Harris has worked powerfully for her fellow Democrats. She is now using it for her own presidential run, which could put her in the best position to challenge Beto O’Rourke and Bernie Sanders on small-dollar donations.• The Senate blocked consideration of the Green New Deal, after hours of discussion in which Republicans painted its Democratic supporters as out-of-touch socialists and fantasists.• The Air Force of three decades ago was a challenging place for women. Sexual harassment, and worse, was rampant. So when a male superior officer raped Martha McSally, a young servicewoman who is now a senator, it wasn’t surprising that she did not report it.• House Democrats responded bluntly to a letter from Representative Rashida Tlaib, the freshman firebrand, seeking an inquiry into impeaching President Trump. “We’re not focused on impeachment,” said one.• Nearly a year after imposing stiff tariffs on foreign metals, the United States is pressing Canada and Mexico to agree to permanent limits on the amount of steel and aluminum they export to America each year. Both have said no.• Joseph R. Biden Jr. said Tuesday that he regretted his role in the 1991 hearings over Anita Hill’s sexual harassment allegations against Clarence Thomas, who became a Supreme Court justice. That episode could be a vulnerability if Mr. Biden runs for president.• A divided Supreme Court returned to the subject of partisan gerrymandering, considering whether drawing election maps to help the party in power ever violates the Constitution. (Here’s an explainer, if you’re confused about what gerrymandering is.)• Long before the grounding of the 737 Max, the Federal Aviation Administration faced scrutiny over its practice of letting manufacturers help certify their own planes. F.A.A. employees viewed their management as “having too close a relationship with Boeing officials,” a government inquiry found years ago._____________________Today’s On Politics briefing was compiled by Isabella Grullón Paz in New York.Were you forwarded this newsletter?
