The children eventually were found in the Mexican town of Tenango del Aire and reunited with their mother in New York.The mother had been a member of Lev Tahor— her father founded the sect in 1994 — but fled the group last year after its leadership became increasingly extreme, according to the FBI.The sect has been accused of subjecting children to physical and sexual abuse.The criminal complaint says Lev Tahor considers the 14-year-old girl to be the wife of Jacob Rosner, one of the men charged in the December kidnapping.___This story has been corrected to show that the court appearance was in White Plains, not Manhattan.Advertisement
