His death fueled simmering discontent in Washington over Saudi Arabia's human rights record and heavy civilian casualties in Yemen's civil war, where a Saudi-led coalition is fighting Iran-backed Houthi rebels.Lawmakers have been sharply critical of Mohammed bin Salman. Some blame him for Khashoggi's killing and other human rights abuses.Eleven suspects have been indicted in Saudi Arabia in Khashoggi's murder. Riyadh has denied the crown prince ordered the killing.
