But the labs have consistently completed more requests over time.The report found a jump from 91,000 to 169,000 backlogged cases, based on data provided by agencies that receive grant money from the Justice Department.The watchdog found advancements in DNA and state laws requiring analysis in some cases, including sexual assaults, led to the increase in requests.The Justice Department said the demand is partially due to requests to process DNA from unsolved homicides and sexual assaults and potentially erroneous convictions.Advertisement
