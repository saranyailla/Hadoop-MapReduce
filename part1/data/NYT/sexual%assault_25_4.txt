The main suspect is accused of leading the men in producing footage which they distributed internationally, sometimes on live internet broadcasts, in order to receive similar material from other countries in exchange, police said.The illegal material received from abroad and redistributed by the Finnish ring included footage of a child being killed during the abuse, the investigation team said.Springare declined to give details about the suspects or places where the crimes had taken place, to protect the victims' privacy.The police will now hand the case over to the prosecutor who will consider whether to bring charges against the suspects.
