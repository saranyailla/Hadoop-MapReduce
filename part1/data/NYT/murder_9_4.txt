Jury selection in his trial is scheduled to begin Monday.News outlets report Duke's attorneys filed an emergency motion Tuesday with the Georgia Supreme Court, saying the trial judge wrongly denied Duke funding to pay for expert witnesses in DNA, false confessions and psychology.A similarly named co-defendant, Bo Dukes, was convicted at a separate trial last Thursday of concealing Grinstead's death. He confessed to investigators to helping Duke burn the woman's body in a pecan orchard.Advertisement
