The trucks carrying the fuel did not stop and reached the Angra dos Reis nuclear plant safely.The company said the criminals apparently were caught off-guard by the convoy."Some bandits, frightened by the strong police presence, shot at a (police) vehicle", Eletronuclear said.Brazil's Federal Highway Police said it had seized a dozen 9mm bullets that had been left behind by attackers at the scene.Authorities did not say whether an investigation had been opened, but the G1 news portal reported there were police operations Wednesday in Frade and another Angra dos Reis neighborhood.The incident raise security concerns in the area, home to Brazil's sole power plant and where drug traffickers are known to operate.In 2017, an American diplomat was shot in the foot during an attempted robbery on a coastal road in the tourist town of Angra dos Reis. Earlier that year, Eloise Dixon, a British tourist, was also hit by a bullet when she and her family strayed into another rough neighborhood.Electronuclear said the uranium transported was in its "natural state" and therefore did not pose a threat to the population or the environment.Advertisement
