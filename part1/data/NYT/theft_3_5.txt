The lawsuit noted that some families who sought Parcells' services believed he had medical qualifications and was licensed to perform the exams.Parcells, 37, also faces criminal charges filed last week by Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt's office. Parcells is charged with theft and criminal desecration in regard to the autopsies.His attorney, Eric Kjorlie, said they're considering their next steps.Parcells assisted a privately hired pathologist in a second autopsy of Brown in 2014, after St. Louis County performed an initial examination but Brown's family and attorneys wanted an independent review.Brown was 18 and unarmed when he was fatally shot by Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson on Aug. 9, 2014. Wilson resigned from the police force that November, and he was later cleared of wrongdoing by a St. Louis County grand jury and the U.S. Justice Department.The shooting and lack of charges against Wilson sparked nationwide protests and helped fuel the Black Lives Matter movement.___Information from: The Kansas City Star, http://www.kcstar.comAdvertisement
