The company was eventually forced to shut down two facilities, including the one where the treatment was videotaped."Today's news is an important step forward as we resume our work in Arizona," said Geraldo Rivera, vice president for immigrant children's services at the nonprofit. "I'm proud of the progress we've made together in the last few months."The videos are blurry but show staffers dragging three children on the ground and shoving a boy against a door.In one video, a staffer is seen sitting at a conference room table, fidgeting with her hair, while another drags a child into the room. The treatment continued even after the child fell to the ground.The shelter, known as Hacienda del Sol, held immigrant children who came to the U.S. without a parent or in some cases were separated from family.Advertisement
