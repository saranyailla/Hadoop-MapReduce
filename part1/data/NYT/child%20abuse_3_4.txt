Jackson died in 2009.The show previously was exhibited in London.Cullinan said it "was never celebratory. It's about the complexity of Michael Jackson, how he means very different things to many very different people."Ellen Heimes, who heads a local branch of Germany's largest child protection organization, said the show should prompt a debate about spotting and preventing child abuse.Advertisement
