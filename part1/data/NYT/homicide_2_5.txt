When representatives for Maupassant’s estate saw the finished film, they found it so remote from anything the author wrote that they asked that he not be cited in the credits.I thought of this anecdote while watching “Out of Blue,” which, its end credits do tell us, was adapted from Martin Amis’s 1997 novel, “Night Train.” Written and directed by Carol Morley, the movie retains several of the novel’s central characters, but it is so far from the source material otherwise that midway through I asked myself, “Hey, isn’t that the name of a character in a Martin Amis novel?”That name is of Mike Hoolihan, a homicide detective in New Orleans. She’s played by Patricia Clarkson, who clearly enjoys doing detective postures. A recovering alcoholic, Mike is investigating the puzzling death of Jennifer Rockwell, an astronomer whose words “In order for us to live, a star has to die” are the first we hear. An eager colleague of Mike’s wonders if this is the work of “the 38-caliber killer,” who terrorized their city back in the day.“He’d be old by now,” he offers helpfully. There’s but a single elderly person in the primary cast, so don’t strain yourself.“Out of Blue” botches the source material’s story, misses its mordant humor and inverts its despairing core. Much of this is the filmmaker’s prerogative. But “Out of Blue” doesn’t strike out only as an adaptation. What it offers on its own is tepid and predictable.Movie data powered by IMDb.comNot rated.
