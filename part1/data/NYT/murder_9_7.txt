The Vernon Parish Sheriff's Department says Smith gave authorities conflicting statements during this month's trial of Tobias Williams, who was found guilty last week of killing Jonathan Ellis.The sheriff's office says Smith changed her testimony during the course of the trial in an effort to exonerate Williams and blame an unknown masked assailant. It says prosecutors were able to prove Smith's testimony was "outlandish and false" during the closing arguments of the trial.It's unclear if Smith has a lawyer. Williams is set to be sentenced next month.Advertisement
