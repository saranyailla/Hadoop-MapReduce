Oral arguments before the high court were set for May 7.Jury selection had been scheduled to begin Monday in rural Irwin County, where Duke is charged with the slaying of Tara Grinstead.The teacher and beauty queen's disappearance in October 2005 baffled her hometown of Ocilla, and her face loomed for years on a billboard seeking tips. Her death was confirmed after Duke and another man were arrested in 2017.Duke's defense attorneys appealed to the state Supreme Court after the trial judge denied them funding for expert witnesses in DNA, false confessions, and psychology.Superior Court Judge Bill Reinhardt had found Duke was unable to pay for his defense. But the judge denied him money for defense experts after Duke accepted the offer of two private attorneys willing to defend him for free, as opposed to being appointed a state-funded public defender.The Supreme Court's order Thursday said Duke's pretrial appeal raised "difficult and important issues for which there does not appear to be controlling legal precedent." But the court questioned whether it has jurisdiction before Duke stands trial. The May 7 hearing will deal with that issue.Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent Jason Shoudel testified at a pretrial hearing that Duke confessed to killing Grinstead nearly 14 years ago after he broke into her home to steal money for drugs. GBI agents have also said DNA matching both Duke and Grinstead was found on a latex glove discovered in her yard.Duke's attorneys have said he made a false confession under the influence of drugs. They said in court filings Duke was asleep at home when Grinstead was killed.The suspect's former best friend and similarly named co-defendant, Bo Dukes, was convicted last week of helping conceal Grinstead's death. He told authorities he helped Duke burn her body in a rural pecan orchard. A judge sentenced Dukes last Friday to 25 years in prison.Advertisement
