The footage has been shown at several of his rallies across Turkey since the attack, including on Thursday, drawing condemnation from New Zealand and Australia. Peters and Erdogan are to attend an emergency meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) on Friday in Istanbul over the shootings in Christchurch and Islamophobia. The OIC groups together Muslim countries to protect the interest of the Muslim world. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has said Peters was headed to Turkey to "confront" comments made by Erdogan on the killings, and she repeated on Friday he was there to "set the record straight."Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison earlier this week called the comments "deeply offensive" and summoned Turkey's ambassador for a meeting, though on Thursday he said progress had been made and "we've already seen the moderation of the president's (Erdogan's) views."
