The most severe option it could impose would be to revoke Hill's law license by disbarring him in the state.Losing his state attorney's license or having it suspended could threaten Hill's position as attorney general because Indiana law specifies the attorney general must be "duly licensed to practice law in Indiana."The court's other options include imposing short-term or long-term suspensions of Hill's law license, public or private reprimands, or finding that no misconduct had occurred.Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb and other state officials called for Hill to resign after the allegations became public last July. But Republican leaders have shown no signs of taking action against Hill since the special prosecutor declined to pursue any criminal charges against him.Lundberg's filing argues, among other things, that in his recollection and belief "it is unprecedented" for the disciplinary commission to charge an attorney with a violating Indiana's professional conduct rules after a prosecutor has declined to file criminal charges against that person.Attorneys for the women have said they intend to sue Hill, the state of Indiana and the attorney general's office.Lundberg's motion also alludes to that planned litigation by saying that it "is imprudent" for the commission to use its power of lawyer disciplinary proceedings to "seek an adjudication of factual and legal issues that may benefit the private interests of putative litigants against the State of Indiana."In its administrative finding, the disciplinary commission alleged that Hill committed misdemeanor battery against all four women and felony sexual battery against one of them when he allegedly touched her buttocks after she tried to halt his groping at the party.Lundberg's filing states that Indiana's professional conduct rules require "that any alleged criminal conduct reflect adversely on a lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects" but his motion contends that "neither battery nor sexual battery is a crime of dishonesty or breach of trust."___This story has been corrected to reflect that the motion was filed with the Indiana Supreme Court.Advertisement
