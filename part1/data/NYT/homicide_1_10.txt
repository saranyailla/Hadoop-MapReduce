Kevin Mansell and Officers Danny Vasquez and Dustin Dillard.Their cases arose from the death of Anthony Timpa , who was arrested for erratic behavior and later died at a hospital. Police say the 32-year-old was combative.The Dallas County Medical Examiner ruled the death a homicide, saying Timpa died of cardiac arrest caused by the effects of cocaine and the stress of physical restraint.In 2017, a grand jury concluded the officers acted recklessly during the arrest. The District Attorney's office says three medical examiners said they don't believe the officers were reckless.Advertisement
