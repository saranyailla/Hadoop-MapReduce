When they returned to the car, he said, the officer saw what appeared to be blood in the car."We believe ... that she simply mistakenly got into this particular car thinking it was an Uber ride," Holbrook said of Josephson, noting that surveillance video captured her getting into the car. "She opened the door and got into it and departed with the suspect driving."Rowland will be charged with murder and kidnapping, Rowland said. It was unclear if he had an attorney.Holbrook said hunters found Josephson's body late Friday afternoon off a dirt road in rural Clarendon County, which is about 65 miles (105 kilometers) southeast of Columbia.Advertisement
