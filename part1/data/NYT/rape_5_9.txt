So that I could kill him."He later told "Good Morning America" that he is not a racist and moved past his desire for violence after seeking help from a priest and from friends. But the controversy overshadowed his new film, "Cold Pursuit."In his latest statement, Neeson said he has had time to reflect on "my unacceptable thoughts and actions at that time." He said that in trying to explain his feelings, he "missed the point and hurt many people." He ended the 155-word statement by saying: "I profoundly apologize."Advertisement
