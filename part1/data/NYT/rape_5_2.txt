A U.N. fact-finding mission last year said the military campaign was orchestrated with "genocidal intent" and recommended charging Min Aung Hlaing and five other generals with the "gravest crimes under international law".Myanmar has denied the accusations of murder, rape and other abuses by its forces though Min Aung Hlaing said last month "a number of security men may have been involved".A previous military investigation in 2017 exonerated the security forces of any crimes.The new court is "another bad faith maneuver" to fend off international pressure, said Nicholas Bequelin, Southeast Asia and Pacific Director of Amnesty International."The military stands accused of the gravest crimes under international law and has shown no sign of reform," he said."The idea that the Tatmadaw could investigate itself and ensure justice and accountability is both dangerous and delusional," Bequelin added, referring to the army.The military information unit did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.Myanmar is facing growing international calls for accountability over the Rakhine campaign.The International Criminal Court has opened a preliminary examination into the violence, while a commission of enquiry formed by Myanmar and including Filipino diplomat Rosario Manalo and Kenzo Oshima, Japan's former ambassador to the U.N., is due to publish its findings this year.The creation of the military court was based on assessments and suggestions from the military-appointed Judge Advocate-General, as well the allegations contained in human rights reports, according to the army statement.
