Former FARC fighters have also reported being forced to have abortions."Obviously there were rape cases," Londono, better known by his nom de guerre Timochenko, told local Blu Radio. "Of the cases that I know about, all of (the rapists) were condemned to execution by firing squad.""That sounds harsh but that's how we acted."Sexual violence was not widespread, Londono added, and relationships were consensual.The White Rose, a organization of women who say they were forcibly recruited, raped and forced to have abortions by the FARC and other armed groups, said on Twitter that Londono was a "cynical criminal."The group decried other comments from the interview in which Londono said girls from the countryside begin sexual activity at a young age."That's how he justifies that they were abused in the FARC. That's the way these criminals justify the acts for which they shouldn't have impunity," the group said.Marches are set to take place in Bogota and other cities on Monday evening, with protesters urging the government not to support Duque's proposed changes to the JEP.Some 13,000 fighters and collaborators of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia handed over their weapons as part of the peace deal, the majority receiving amnesty. The group's political party has kept its famous initials, renaming itself the Revolutionary Alternative Common Force.  (Reporting by Julia Symmes Cobb; Editing by Alistair Bell)Advertisement
