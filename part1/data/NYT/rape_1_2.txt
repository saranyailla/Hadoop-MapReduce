He is also the last of four teens whose case has been moved from adult court to juvenile court.Prosecutors said the 15-year-old instigated the attack. But the juvenile's attorney said the judge did the right thing by sending the case to juvenile court. He said his client couldn't control his impulses due to severe and untreated attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD.Authorities said the teens restrained four 14-year-olds before an October football practice at Damascus High School and raped them or attempted to rape them with broomsticks.___Information from: The Washington Post, http://www.washingtonpost.comAdvertisement
