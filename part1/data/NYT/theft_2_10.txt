The suspect, 29-year-old Robert Greeson, shot Kunz in his upper torso, above his protective vest.

We honor his service."Kunze's wife, Kathleen Kunze, reached the settlement amount during a March 14 hearing, according to the agreement. The county paid Kathleen Kunze a $30,000 check at the time, and she'll soon receive the remaining $120,000 since the settlement has been approved.Kunze's daughter, Alyssa, will receive half of the money."Everyone worked tirelessly to make sure that we took care of and honored Deputy Kunze and took care of his family," Dennis said. "This (settlement) is one of the steps in that process."___Information from: The Wichita (Kan.) Eagle, http://www.kansas.comAdvertisement
