The ban set to go into effect Tuesday has put the Trump administration in the unusual position of arguing against gun rights groups. It's unclear how quickly the court will act.President Donald Trump said last year that the government would move to ban bump stocks. The action followed a 2017 shooting in Las Vegas in which a gunman attached bump stocks to assault-style rifles he used to shoot concertgoers. Fifty-eight people were killed.Advertisement
