Analysts say that has helped Caputova as Sefcovic, mindful of his position in Brussels and with EU elections two months away, is unlikely to attack too hard."Sefcovic has refused to get dirty in the campaign and attack Caputova in a way that the anti-system candidates would," said political analyst Samuel Abraham, who heads the Bratislava International School of Liberal Arts.He said only a failure of Caputova's voters to show up by taking her victory as a given due to polls could threaten that."She needs to mobilize her voters," he said.Caputova, a 45-year-old lawyer, was previously best known for a long fight against an illegal landfill in her hometown.Sefcovic, who is also pro-European, said he would seek to unite the divided country and has pitched his Christian values to court socially conservative voters, gaining backing from some in the church in the predominantly Catholic country of 5.4 million.But on Thursday, Caputova was endorsed by the junior government party Most-Hid, which represents the country's ethic Hungarian minority. Outgoing President Andrej Kiska, who defeated Fico in the last presidential vote in 2014 by gaining 59.4 percent, has also backed Caputova.(Reporting by Tatiana Jancarikova, Writing by Jason Hovet, Editing by Robin Pomeroy, William Maclean)Advertisement
