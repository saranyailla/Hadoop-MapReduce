"That was exciting ... It's fantastic, so unbelievably beautiful."Brand said he had first heard the painting was in the Netherlands in 2015. He told the broadcaster he believes it may have been traded back and forth "20 times" in the Amsterdam underworld, used as collateral in drugs and weapons deals.He said the final owner was a real estate agent who wanted to be rid of it after he realized it was stolen. Brand said two men contacted him and arranged the drop-off at his house.Dutch police told local media they were not taking further action, as the painting has been returned and the statute of limitations in the 1999 theft has expired.The owner, identified as Saudi businessman Abdulmohsen Abdulmalik Al al-Sheikh, could not immediately be reached for comment.
