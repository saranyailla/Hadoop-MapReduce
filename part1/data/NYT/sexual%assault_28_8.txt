Hill's name is listed on the report.His fiancee, Crystal Espinal, is listed on the March 14 report under the category of "others involved." The Star reported that Espinal is pregnant with twins and that she is the mother of the 3-year-old whose arm was broken.Hill reportedly choked and punched Espinal when she was pregnant in December 2014. Hill was arrested and dismissed from the Oklahoma State football team.Hill later pleaded guilty to domestic assault and battery by strangulation and received three years' probation.The Chiefs issued the following statement last week regarding Hill:"The club is aware of the investigation involving Tyreek Hill," the Chiefs said in a statement to The Kansas City Star. "We're in the process of gathering information and have been in contact with the league and local authorities. We'll have no further comment at this time."--Field Level MediaAdvertisement
