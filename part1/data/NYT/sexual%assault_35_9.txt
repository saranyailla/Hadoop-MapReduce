They must then maintain it below that level continuously.CAS upheld an appeal by Indian sprinter Dutee Chand in a similar case in 2015, stating that the IAAF should provide further evidence to prove a link between higher levels of testosterone and athletic performance.The IAAF claim they now have the scientific proof of unfair advantage for DSD athletes and that this was presented to CAS at Semenya's five-day hearing in February, but this is disputed by ASA."The IAAF was required to place empirical evidence... to establish that the naturally occurring testosterone levels of athletes targeted by the DSD Regulations confer a significant performance advantage... which would justify limiting their eligibility to compete in the manner that the IAAF seeks to do through the DSD Regulations," an ASA statement said on Friday. "The IAAF has again failed to do so in the proceedings before CAS, and has sought rather to contend that female athletes targeted by the DSD Regulations are in fact "biologically male"."The analyses relied on by the IAAF do (sic) not show a meaningful relationship between testosterone and performance."REGULATION CHANGESASA have also claimed that the IAAF have sought to amend their regulations, without going into details of what the changes are."The delay in handing down the CAS award is entirely due to the IAAF seeking to amend the regulations post the CAS hearing. This necessitated a further exchange of written argument between the parties," the statement said.The IAAF responded in a statement emailed to Reuters, saying: "We are unable to share evidence and information provided to CAS whilst deliberations are ongoing."The IAAF does agree on one point in the ASA press release that is the right of third parties and the media to openly debate issues arising from the IAAF's DSD Regulations and that this should be done responsibly and sensitively with due regard to the rights of the parties concerned."It is with this in mind that the IAAF continues to respond to media enquiries on the issue, on statements released and, where necessary, correcting incorrect information."
