He also wants to toughen sentencing and objected to the suspension of investigations by ordinary authorities into cases submitted to the JEP. Duque also asked congress to exclude sexual crimes from the tribunal's remit.All laws associated with the accord were approved by the previous congress, whose term ended last year, and most points received the blessing of the court in previous rulings.Duque will need a two-thirds majority to modify the laws, which are now part of the country's constitution. His coalition has a slender majority in the Senate and less than half of the seats in the lower house, making substantive changes to the laws unlikely.
