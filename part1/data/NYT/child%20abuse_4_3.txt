Barbarin, 68, the highest-profile cleric to be caught up in the child sex abuse scandal inside the French Church, received a six-month suspended prison sentence. He has denied the allegations and launched an appeal."When the second court hands down its decision, then we will see what will happen. But we must always have the presumption of innocence. This is important because it goes beyond the superficial condemnation by the media," the pope said."Maybe he is not innocent, but the presumption (of innocence) must be there," the pope said.The Barbarin trial put one of Europe's most senior clergymen in the spotlight at a time when the pope is grappling with criticism over the Church's response to a decades-long sexual global abuse crisis.Barbarin has stepped aside temporarily pending the appeal and has handed over the day-to-day running of the diocese to a vicar general.He has said he would remain head of the dioceses in title and would continue to sign off on documents until the appeal process is over.The Church's credibility has been damaged in much of the world by abuse scandals in countries including Ireland, Chile, Australia, France, the United States and Poland, paying billions of dollars in damages to victims and forcing parishes to close.The scandals have reached the upper echelons of the Vatican itself with the conviction of Cardinal George Pell, jailed this month for six years for abusing boys in his native Australia. He had served as the Vatican treasurer and a member of the pope's innermost council of cardinals until his conviction last year. (Reporting by Philip Pullella; Editing by Peter Cooney)Advertisement
