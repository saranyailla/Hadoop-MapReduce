The iPhone maker is banking on growing its services business to offset a dip in smartphone sales. While the Wall Street Journal plans to join Apple's new subscription news service, other major publishers, including the New York Times and the Washington Post, have declined, according to a New York Times report. Apple has also partnered with Hollywood celebrities to make a streaming debut with a slate of original content, taking a page out of Netflix Inc's playbook.
