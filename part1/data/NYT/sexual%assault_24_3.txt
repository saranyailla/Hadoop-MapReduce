John McCain was everything Donald Trump is not.John WiseGuerneville, Calif.To the Editor:President Trump’s continued assaults on Senator John McCain seven months after his death aptly remind The Times of his attacks on a Gold Star father, Khizr Khan. But the most obvious comparison is to Mr. Trump’s continued attacks on Hillary Clinton, long after he had beaten her and become president. He can’t let go of Hillary Clinton. He can’t let go of John McCain. These add more weight to the concerns that George Conway, the husband of Kellyanne Conway, has expressed about the president’s mental and emotional health.And it’s time for the Senate to step in and uphold the dignity of Mr. McCain by taking up a proposal by the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, to rename the Russell Senate Office Building  (named for a mostly forgotten segregationist and white supremacist) for Mr. McCain.James AdlerCambridge, Mass.Advertisement
