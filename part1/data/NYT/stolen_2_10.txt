One of their allegations was that Martin talked online with people in Russian and other languages but they never found proof he shared stolen information with anyone.His lawyers said he was a hoarder who liked to take work home with him. "His actions were the product of mental illness. Not treason," lawyers Deborah Boardman and James Wyda said in a statement.Martin and the government agreed that if the federal court in Baltimore accepted the plea agreement, he would be sentenced to nine years in prison on the charge of willful retention of national defense information, prosecutors said. Sentencing was set for July 17 by U.S. District Judge Richard Bennett. (Reporting By Mark Hosenball; additional reporting by Andrew Hay in New Mexico; Editing by Grant McCool)Advertisement
