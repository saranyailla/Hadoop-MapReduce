Faruq and Tasvirul Islam, who is a district leader of the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), were arrested for negligence and violations of a national building code that resulted in casualties."It was a very painful incident. After an investigation, we will file a charge sheet in the court," he said, adding they could face murder charges.Baten said police were also looking for the owner of the developers that constructed the building in the 1990s.Helicopters joined 22 firefighting units in battling the blaze, along with police and armed forces, as some of those trapped in the building waved desperately for help from its windows and roof.Foyzur Rahman, the head of an investigation team formed by the Ministry of Disaster Management, said testimony was being heard from survivors in an attempt to find the cause of the blaze."Their accounts will help us to come up with realistic recommendations to prevent such things in future," he told reporters on Sunday.The opposition BNP criticized the government over the fire, alleging negligence in upgrading the fire service."The government spent huge money to purchase lethal weapons to suppress the opposition party and democratic process, but did nothing to upgrade the fire service," Ruhul Kabir Rizvi, a senior BNP leader told reporters.Last week's blaze came a month after an inferno killed 71 people in an old neighborhood of the city.
