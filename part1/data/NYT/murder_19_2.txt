The attorneys said juror misconduct denied Guzman his right to a fair trial."If a justice system's measure is how it treats the most reviled and unpopular, then ours may have failed Joaquin Guzman by denying him the fair trial before an untainted jury to which he's constitutionally entitled," Guzman's attorneys wrote in a court filing. "Because sunlight is the best disinfectant, that prospect merits serious consideration, close investigation and a new trial as appropriate."A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn declined to comment.The defense motion claims jurors "actively sought out and openly discussed" sensational allegations that had been excluded from Guzman's proceedings, including a claim by a government witness that Guzman raped girls. The government did not charge Guzman with rape.The defense team also accused jurors of "cannily lying" to the judge when he asked them about their exposure to media coverage in Guzman's case."We look forward to vindicating his rights in a new trial before a jury that will abide by its oath," defense attorney Eduardo Balarezo said in an email.Guzman faces life in prison at his June sentencing.Advertisement
