So that I could ... kill him."The celebrity red carpet portion of the New York premiere for "Cold Pursuit" was subsequently canceled and the film performed poorly at the box office.Neeson, 66, issued his statement on Friday saying he had spent several weeks reflecting on his words and speaking with people who were hurt by them."What I failed to realize is that this is not about justifying my anger all those years ago, it is also about the impact my words have today," he said."Although the comments I made do not reflect, in any way, my true feelings nor me, they were hurtful and divisive. I profoundly apologize."  (Reporting by Jill Serjeant; Editing by Bill Rigby)Advertisement
