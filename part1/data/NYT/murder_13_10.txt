He has also been undergoing a psychological evaluation.In a rare act of gun violence in the Netherlands, Gokmen allegedly opened fire in a tram in the central Dutch city of Utrecht on March 18. Those killed included a 19-year-old woman, a 28 year-old-man, and the 49-year-old father of two young children. One victim remains in hospital in critical condition.A Dutch court will rule by the end of next week on extending Gokmen's custody.
