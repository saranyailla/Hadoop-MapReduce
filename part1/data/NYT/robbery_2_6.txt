Gujarat and Jammu must weigh heavily on your soul."Later in a press conference on Sunday, he referred to religious riots in Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state of Gujarat in 2002 during which more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed. In Jammu and Kashmir, India's only Muslim-majority state, Pakistan accuses India of human rights violations, a charge New Delhi denies.An Indian foreign ministry source cited three more instances of forceful marriages of Hindu or Sikh women in Pakistan in the past two years and said that the government had raised "intimidation of Sikhs, Hindus, and desecration of their places of worship" with Pakistan on various occasions.The Indian government run by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will seek a second term in a general election starting next month. Modi has taken a tougher stand towards Pakistan in the past five years. (Reporting by Krishna N. Das, Syed Raza Hassan and Saad Sayeed; Editing by Michael Perry)Advertisement
