This is a robbery."La Liga's organising body declined to comment on whether the Segunda Division would consider ending fixtures during the international break.Such a move would mean more midweek matches or extending the season, which already finishes three weeks later than the top flight with playoff games continuing deep into June.A spokesman for Segunda Division leaders Osasuna said adopting the international break was not on the agenda but added that the club would not oppose more midweek fixtures in future to accommodate a break.Midweek games in Spain typically attract lower attendances and television audiences than weekend matches, but Las Palmas sporting director Toni Otero urged the league to consider moving kick-off times to avoid more clashes with international games.“We need to have a meeting with La Liga. The Segunda could easily play three games per year on Wednesdays, if they do it in La Liga why not in the Segunda," Otero said. (Reporting by Richard Martin; Editing by Ken Ferris)Advertisement
