It stands as one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history.Richman's body was found shortly after 7 a.m. EDT (1100 GMT) at his office, police said."The death appears to be a suicide, but police will not disclose the method or any other details of the death, only to state the death does not appear to be suspicious," the Newtown Police Department said in a statement. Connecticut's Chief Medical Examiner's office is expected to confirm the cause of death later on Monday, police said.After his daughter's murder, Richman and his wife, Jennifer Hensel, created a foundation in her name that focuses on preventing violence by funding research on mental health and increasing access to treatment.Richman, who was a neuropharmacologist, had written in a mission statement published on the Avielle Foundation's website that his daughter's death had left him "infinitely heart broken."In a statement, the foundation said that while its staff and directors were "crushed to pieces" at Richman's death, it would continue its work of supporting research into brain abnormalities and promoting brain health. "Tragically, his death speaks to how insidious and formidable a challenge brain health can be and how critical it is for all of us to seek help for ourselves, our loved ones and anyone who we suspect may be in need," the foundation said.U.S. Representative Jahana Hayes, who represents a congressional district that includes Newtown, said in a statement she was struck by how "optimistic" Richman had seemed about his foundation's work at a recent meeting."These tragedies show that the trauma of gun violence extends far beyond the initial tragedy," her statement said.U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut called Richman a "good friend, a dedicated father, an esteemed researcher."
