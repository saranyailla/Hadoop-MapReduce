Erdogan later on Friday again showed an excerpt of the video at an election rally in the central city of Konya."I did not see any sound, peaceful purposes in raising it," Peters said, adding that they had received "very assuring information" from the Turkish presidency.Speaking at the emergency session, Peters told representatives of Muslim nations: "no punishment can match the depravity of his crime but the families of the fallen will have justice."He also screened moving photographs of New Zealanders mourning the victims.  Brenton Harrison Tarrant, a 28-year-old Australian, was arrested and charged with murder in the New Zealand mosque attacks. Tarrant livestreamed the attack and released a manifesto describing his white supremacist views and how he planned the shootings.The OIC, in a statement, urged all countries to refrain from statements or policies that associate Islam with terror and extremism. It also demanded that March 15 — the day of the Christchurch attack — be marked as the International Day of Solidarity Against Islamophobia.Addressing the OIC meeting Friday, Erdogan praised New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, saying her "reaction, the empathy displayed and her solidarity with Muslims" should serve as an example to all leaders.Erdogan slammed populist politicians who he said encouraged attacks on Muslims and refugees."Politicans who pave themselves the road to power by alienating Muslims and creating enemies out of refugees, must pull themselves together," he said.He also called for neo-Nazi groups to be considered terrorists."If we don't show our reaction in a strong manner, the neo-Nazi virus will engulf the body even more," Erdogan said. "If we don't raise our voices, Western governments will not disrupt their comfort."  ___Suzan Fraser reported from Ankara.Advertisement
