We hear from the Chicago prosecutor on the other side of the case.Thursday, March 28th, 2019michael barbaroFrom The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Earlier this year, Chicago’s top prosecutor, Kim Foxx, took the unusual step of asking women to come forward with allegations against the musician R. Kelly. Today, she explains that decision. It’s Thursday, March 28.john eligonHello?kim foxxYes, we’re here.john eligonO.K., O.K., good.michael barbaroSo, John, why did you call this prosecutor, Kim Foxx?john eligonSo R. Kelly is one of these entertainers who’s had these allegations of sexual misconduct swirling around him for a long time, but he’s always seemed to be able to elude the most serious consequences.michael barbaroJohn Eligon is a national correspondent for The Times.john eligonBut we’re in a moment where the tide seems to be turning against him. And I wanted to talk to the person who has the most power to do something about it.john eligonSo tell me a little about growing up, and then kind of just what life was like for you growing up in the city.kim foxxYeah, sure, so I was born and raised here in the city. My mom —john eligonI found out that, in a way, Kim Foxx is actually of a background and of a pedigree that would make her the perfect person that you would expect to look into this R. Kelly situation.michael barbaroHmm. What do you mean? Who is she?john eligonSo she’s a born-and-bred Chicagoan, just like R. Kelly. She’s black. She grew up on the North Side with her mother.kim foxxWe lived in Cabrini, through the ‘70s until the early ‘80s —john eligonThey lived in the notorious Cabrini-Green housing project.kim foxx— and then moved about a mile north to a more affluent neighborhood called Old Town, Lincoln Park, so that my brother and I could go to the grammar school that was in the neighborhood.john eligonShe bounced around different houses.kim foxxWe moved annually. We were either on Section 8 or some other type of government assistance.john eligonIt was just her and her mom.kim foxxMy mother worked the entire time, but it was certainly not enough for us to live there.john eligonHer mom worked a lot. She waited tables, she bartended. She was always working two jobs at a time. And so other family members would take care of her.kim foxxAnd it was — the older folks had to watch the younger ones. So I had a cousin who was responsible for watching me, sometimes at his house, sometimes at my —john eligonShe explained to me that when she was a child, she actually had a cousin who she spent a lot of time with.kim foxxAnd he would touch me.john eligonAnd it actually turned out that that cousin would sexually assault her.kim foxxAnd this was for a couple of years.john eligonAnd the cousin essentially told her —kim foxxDon’t tell anybody.john eligon— don’t tell anyone.kim foxxThis is just between you and I. If you tell someone, you’re going to be in trouble. If you tell granny — my grandmother, who was the most important person in my life at that time — granny would be disappointed. Or that he would hurt granny. Like if you tell this, I’m going to hurt her.john eligonAnd then, just a year later, when she was in second grade, she was assaulted again.kim foxxOn my way home from school, there was a house on the corner, an old Victorian. And as I was turning in front of this old house, two older boys grabbed me and said, hey, come with us, we want to show you something. And me saying, listen, I gotta get home. I’m in second grade at this point. I think these boys maybe are eighth graders, maybe a little older. I can’t — everyone seems old. And they said, no, you’re going with us, and took me into this house, upstairs, in the window facing where I could still see the school.john eligonShe recalled looking out the window, and essentially the boys were taking turns assaulting her. And around the same time she’s dealing with the traumas, she has another defining moment in her life.kim foxxI think I was between 5 and 6. My mother took me to court for the first time.john eligonAs a child, she actually went to court with her mother once, who was seeking child support payments from her father.kim foxxMy mother was upset. I couldn’t comprehend what was so upsetting to her. And when we get to the courtroom, I think she was feeling my apprehension and was trying to explain to me who our lawyer was — what a lawyer was. And it was very simple. It was, they’re here to help us. And I was impressed that they were wearing suits. They were using language that seemed really fancy, and at the same time were talking to my mom and I like we were the most important people in the room. And I said, wow, I want to do that. I want to do that. And my mother said, then you will be a lawyer. So it shall be.john eligonAnd she does it. She does well in school, goes to college and then law school.michael barbaroAnd what kind of legal work does she do?john eligonInitially, she does insurance defense work. And as you might expect —kim foxxI absolutely hated it.john eligonShe found that pretty boring and pretty dry.kim foxxAnd so I was looking to get out. I was looking for another job.john eligonSo she found out that there was an opening at the Cook County Public Guardian office.kim foxxI wasn’t quite sure when the Cook County Public Guardian’s office did. What I did know is that they were hiring.john eligonLo and behold, what she actually does there, she works with young children, children who may have experienced some of the same things that she experienced, whether it be sexual assaults or other trauma growing up.kim foxxWe were lawyers on behalf of children who were in the foster care system. I had clients who were sexually and physically abused. I had clients whose parents could not care for them because they were dealing with addiction or mental health issues.john eligonAnd this really helps her to see how the system maybe doesn’t treat these young victims the way it should. Maybe it dismisses them.kim foxxBecause these were throwaway kids. These were kids who I had heard over and over again were broken, were damaged.john eligonSo she says, hey, this is what I want to do. I want to bring the trauma that I have felt in my life and use that to help children who might have lived a similar life to me or might be living a similar life to what I lived.michael barbaroAnd how does she use her experience to help these children?john eligonShe becomes a sex crimes prosecutor. So now she is essentially going after some of the people accused of sexually assaulting women, and boys, and men, and she’s actually working with some of these victims — people whose experiences and whose stories looked a lot like hers. And then in the early 2000s, a case comes in to the very same office where Kim Foxx is working. And it kind of rocks Chicago, because it charges one of Chicago’s most beloved black celebrities.archived recordingSex, lies and videotape — R&B superstar R. Kelly videotaping himself having sex with an underage girl.john eligonA sex tape emerges.archived recordingThere’s a tape of him urinating and having sex with a young girl.john eligonEveryone sees it. It’s a graphic and gruesome tape. And apparently it ends with him urinating on the girl after having sex.archived recordingThis is a tragedy. He’s one of our greatest artists of our time, I think, and definitely somebody who we looked up to when we was in high school. So I just hope it’s not true.john eligonR. Kelly is ultimately charged with child pornography. And Kim Foxx, she’s actually in the sex crimes division while her office is bringing charges against R. Kelly.kim foxxIt was a sex crimes unit, with a specialty of those in positions of trust and authority were engaging in sexual misconduct with children.john eligonSo she now has a firsthand view of this prosecution as it’s going on. She wasn’t directly involved in the case, but hey, she was in the office when prosecutors were talking about it. But outside the office, Chicagoans —archived recordingI love R. Kelly, and I know he didn’t do it. I know that’s not him.john eligonParticularly black Chicagoans we’re not necessarily convinced that R. Kelly had done this. Many of them were coming to his defense.archived recording 1He’s not guilty at all. They just want to bring him down and kill his image, or who he is.archived recording 2That’s right. He’s not guilty.archived recording 3I need to protect him because he’s a good man. He’s not who — people are making him seem like he’s a monster. He’s not guilty.michael barbaroWhy was there this pushback to the allegations?john eligonBecause back in the early 2000s, you have to remember, R. Kelly was Chicago. I mean, he was everywhere.archived recordingHe’s back again tonight to perform the track “Number One Hit.” Please welcome R. Kelly! [CHEERING]john eligonYou know, he was on the radio.archived recordingMoving up two notches, here’s R. Kelly with his number one on the R&B chart, “Bump N’ Grind.”archived recording (r. kelly)[SINGING]john eligonHe was in the clubs. I was too young to go to the clubs at the time. But he was there, nonetheless.archived recording (r. kelly)[SINGING]john eligonIt’s a two-stepping town. That’s the culture, you know, the two-step dance, “Step in the Name of Love.”michael barbaroIs that one of his songs?john eligonYeah.archived recording (r. kelly)[SINGING]kim foxxThe music was the music. And you would go to a barbecue, and somebody’s stepping in the name of love, or at a wedding, or go to any graduation post-that song, and people were believing they could fly. It was part of the fabric. So there’s Kim who’s at a family barbecue having this conversation, and there’s Kim who’s in the office knowing that this is an actual person.john eligonSo Kim Foxx is hearing two different conversations — one inside the office, and one outside, in the community.kim foxxAt the barbecue, it was — you know, here’s this guy at the height of his career, and here are these allegations, right?john eligonLike, why are they taking down this black man?kim foxxAnd it was, in some of my circles, that this wasn’t about sex abuse, sex assault, or pornography. This was an attempt to take a hometown hero and tarnish his image.john eligonAnd so she had to kind of live with these two worlds.michael barbaroThe reality that, at work, she sees this tape and she understands the legal case against him. And at home, she’s surrounded by people who think that he may be unfairly persecuted here, love his music and think of him as a local hero.john eligonExactly. It’s the difference between her job and her profession and looking at it through legal eyes, versus looking at it through the emotional eyes that a community had for someone who produced great music.michael barbaroAnd so what happens with the case?john eligonThe prosecution essentially tried to prove that the young girl in the video was actually a minor, that she was underage, and that R. Kelly was having sex with her. But it turns out that that girl, she would not cooperate with the prosecution. She did not testify. And at the end of the day, the jury says, hey, we can’t know for certain who was in that video, whether it was a minor that R. Kelly was having sex with. And so R. Kelly is acquitted.michael barbaroAnd what happens after the trial, after R. Kelly is acquitted?john eligonIt certainly does not derail his career. In fact, he goes on, he continues to make music.archived recording (r. kelly)[SINGING]john eligonYou know, he has big duets — with Lady Gaga.archived recording (r. kelly)[SINGING]john eligonHe releases a song with Jay-Z.archived recording (r. kelly)[SINGING]john eligonHe makes television appearances.archived recordingMy next guest believes he can fly, and I, for one, am inclined to take his word for it. Please welcome R. Kelly. [CHEERING]john eligonIn some ways, the accusations become just a big joke.archived recording (dave chappelle)[SINGING]john eligonDave Chappelle did a skit about him.archived recordingYou believe he urinated on a 15-year-old girl.archived recording (dave chappelle)Ooh, hold on, lady, I didn’t say all that. You know, with these tapes, they can do a lot of things. For all I know, that piss was digital. They get crazy with special effects.john eligonBut then, in 2017, a damning story comes out in BuzzFeed.archived recordingWe were horrified at a BuzzFeed report detailing allegations that R. Kelly was holding women against their will in what parents of one of the women described as a cult.john eligonIt basically accuses R. Kelly of running a sexual cabal. And this is happening right before the #MeToo movement starts to take shape.archived recordingIt’s about damn time. We needed to stop rewarding bad behavior a long time ago.john eligonAnd when it takes off, people really seize on the story.archived recording(CHANTING) Mute R. Kelly! Time’s up!john eligonAnd so you have hashtags saying to #MuteRKelly, hashtags talking about #TimesUp.archived recording(CHANTING) Black girls! Black girls! Matter! Matter!john eligonAnd so now you finally have this kind of tide that seems to be turning against R. Kelly, in a way, that this public opinion maybe always festering a little bit beneath the surface really starts to rise. And then —archived recordingThere is a difference between R. Kelly and Robert.john eligonYou see this documentary drop called “Surviving R. Kelly.”archived recordingR. Kelly’s this fun, laughing, loving guy. But Robert is the devil.michael barbaroAnd tell me about this documentary.john eligonSo essentially it was a TV documentary in six parts that aired on Lifetime. And it essentially laid out allegation after allegation against R. Kelly, told by several women who say that they were victimized by him.archived recordingAnd I went to the National Domestic Violence Awareness hotline. And there are 17 questions. There was only two things on that list that Robert hadn’t done to me. And that’s when it became real to me, like, Drea, you’re being abused.john eligonYou had these women who were describing all these different ways in which he not only assaulted them, but he also controlled their lives is how a lot of these women described it.archived recordingI can control what you do, who you do it with, how long you do it, where you going, what you wear, when you eat, when you sleep.john eligonAnd how he would basically use fear and intimidation to control them.archived recordingMy parents were trying to get a hold of me, and they couldn’t. I did not know that my cell phone number was being changed.john eligonControlling their access to using their cell phones. They said that he made them call him daddy.archived recording 1It was instructed to call him daddy during sex. But it went from that to pretty much all the time, he’d be daddy.archived recording 2And I heard a lot about Rob going to Kenwood High School to hang out. And I always wondered, what the heck is he doing hanging around the high school?john eligonAnd one thing that was so remarkable about it, it was not just the women speaking, but it was also handlers, bodyguards and a lot of other people who were part of his life at the time who were laying out some of these very damning allegations. Now it’s important to say that R. Kelly has vehemently denied doing any of that to these women. His lawyers come out forcefully denying the allegations, and saying, basically, that all the women are not telling the truth.michael barbaroAnd what’s the reaction to the documentary?archived recordingSinger R. Kelly might finally have to face the music. Yes, give it up, guys.john eligonThe reaction was massive.archived recording 1The fallout for singer R. Kelly appears to be expanding. His record label, RCA, owned by Sony, has dropped him.archived recording 2Lady Gaga is apologizing to fans for her duet with R. Kelly.john eligonYou had people talking about it all over social media.archived recordingR. Kelly is not us. So on behalf of black men, hashtag, #MuteRKelly.john eligonYou had all sorts of news outlets writing about it.archived recordingSo I know you wrote this op-ed for CNN.com titled, “The Message of ‘Surviving R. Kelly.’” First and foremost, what is the message?john eligonIt was really a part of the daily discussion, really, especially among black communities.archived recordingA lot of people watching the doc were really wondering where the coverage was when it was happening.john eligonYou had a lot of people saying, you know, why didn’t we really see this before, in a way? You know, obviously, there had always been these allegations against him, but somehow they were just kind of dismissed.archived recordingBecause we didn’t do nothing about it the last time. We didn’t react about it the last time. We didn’t say anything, we didn’t defend, we didn’t protect, we didn’t praise, we didn’t promote. Everything was, well, you know, “Step in the Name of Love” is good.john eligonThere was even some black women I talked to in Chicago who said that whether you’re a black person who falls on the side of, say, hey, I’m still going to listen to his music, or you’re someone who’s not, they were all united in saying that they felt that they failed their girls. Meanwhile, Kim Foxx, she’s actually now become the state’s attorney, meaning the top prosecutor in Chicago. And after this documentary drops, people are calling her office. They’re asking, what are you going to do about this?kim foxxWhat are you going to do? How do you see this and not do anything? Right? Like, you watched this documentary, now do something. People assumed that you can watch something on television, and then the criminal justice system will then act.john eligonAnd she wanted to explain to people that that’s not exactly how it works.kim foxxI think part of this was explaining that, in order for the criminal justice system to be involved, it requires victims and witnesses. I just can’t watch something and say, I now believe that, and then that person is guilty. That is not American jurisprudence at all.john eligonAnd so she decides to do this really unusual thing.kim foxxThank you all for gathering.john eligonShe holds a press conference —kim foxxThe recent allegations against entertainer R. Kelly and the recent Lifetime documentary series are deeply, deeply disturbing. I’m here today to encourage victims of sexual assault or domestic violence related to these allegations to please get in touch with our office.john eligon— asking for any women or anyone else who may have information on the sexual assault allegations against R. Kelly to basically come forward and tell their stories.kim foxxPlease come forward. There is nothing that can be done to investigate these allegations without the cooperation of both victims and witnesses. We cannot seek justice without you.john eligonSo essentially, you had a prosecutor asking the public to come forward if they had accusations of sexual assault against a man who was not under indictment or under any charges in her office at the time.kim foxx— stress that it takes the courage to relive and repeatedly re-experience trauma by telling your story of sexual victimization. But we rely heavily on victim accounts and witness statements to prosecute cases involving sexual assault and domestic violence.michael barbaroAnd why is that unusual?john eligonWell, first off, prosecutors generally respond to specific complaints that they get. So some of her critics see it as sort of a fishing expedition. Like, R. Kelly’s lawyer said it basically opens the door for people to come forward with false allegations.michael barbaroSo it’s rare in that it’s such a proactive tactic by a prosecutor to issue a broad, open call for anyone who has been abused or knows something about alleged abuse by R. Kelly to come forward to her so that she could make a case.john eligonExactly.michael barbaroAnd given that, why do you think that she did this, issued this very public call for victims to come forward?john eligonI think what she’d say is that she really wanted to make her office more accessible. Because she understands how difficult it is to get sexual assault victims to come forward, let alone to testify.kim foxxAnd as someone who didn’t say something, it is the underreported cases that often keep me up at night. It is the belief that the system is not set up to welcome those who have been harmed because they are not perfect, because they have found themselves in a circumstance where they believe that they are somehow at fault. That doesn’t mean that I believe the allegations to be true. There are allegations, nonetheless, that are horrifying if true. And that’s our job. Our obligation is to make sure that the justice system is available to everyone who may have believed that they cannot speak their truth.michael barbaroSo John, you spoke with her after this press conference. What was the result of the press conference?john eligonSo after the press conference, several families called in to Kim Foxx’s office with allegations or concerns about their loved ones. Some of them say that their loved ones may have been under R. Kelly’s control. And then another sex tape emerges. It again allegedly shows R. Kelly having sex with an underage girl. And not long after that —kim foxxGood afternoon.john eligon— Kim Foxx steps to the mic again, has another press conference.kim foxxEarlier today, Robert Kelly was indicted before a Cook County grand jury —john eligonAnd this time, she announces that R. Kelly was being charged with 10 counts of sexual abuse.kim foxxAggravated criminal sexual abuse is a Class 2 felony, with a sentencing range of 3 to 7 years per count.john eligonNow in this case, there are four women who are said to be the victims in that case. Three of those women said they were under 17 when it happened. The offenses happened between 1998 and 2010.kim foxx— will appear in bond court tomorrow afternoon. Thank you.michael barbaroWhat specific difference do you think it makes that Kim Foxx had this personal history? How do you think it actually played out in the way that these women came forward?john eligonI think they know that they have someone who is not going to be so quick to judge them. Because oftentimes with sexual assault, these are complicated cases. It’s not necessarily just black or white. You know, there’s relationships that start off as consensual, and then they may change. So this tricky dynamic here when you’re prosecuting sex crimes, where the facts are not always clear, where the victim may not always have the most perfect history. But I think someone like Kim Foxx, who’s kind of made that empathy that she’s had from having experienced this stuff herself, has made that kind of one of the things that she is known for and one of the things that she really puts out there. And I think that that’s going to naturally make people more comfortable that they’re going to be heard if they talk to her.michael barbaroSo it makes sense that women would respond specifically to Kim Foxx and decide to come forward, given who she is. But I wonder if, on the flip side, that a prosecutor with a personal history of abuse who might be seen as having some kind of agenda will end up making the case more legally vulnerable and open to charges, which I think have already materialized from R. Kelly’s defenders, that this is some kind of a crusade.john eligonI asked her about that, and she pushed back and said —kim foxxSo the cumulative effects of my life as a woman, as a woman of color in a city, that informs who I am. But it does not, in any way, which is why I’ve been extraordinarily clear, change that I am obligated by facts, evidence and the law.john eligonMy having gone through this has nothing to do with whether I’m going to follow the facts where they lead me.kim foxxAnd every charging decision that I make has to be brought with that to bear.john eligonShe said it definitely did not lead her to make any sort of legal decisions.michael barbaroSo John, what is going to happen now to R. Kelly?john eligonHe’s got these very serious charges over his head. He’s got a prosecutor who believes strongly in them and who will be pursuing them vigorously. But he’s also, himself, been maintaining his defense. So it seems we have two sides headed for a clash. And what that means is this is very likely headed toward another trial. But this time, it’s going to be Kim Foxx on the other side.michael barbaroJohn, thank you very much, we appreciate it.john eligonThank you.Listen and subscribe to our podcast from your mobile device: Via Apple Podcasts | Via RadioPublic | Via StitcherThis year, Chicago’s top prosecutor, Kim Foxx, took the unusual step of asking women to come forward with allegations against the musician R.
