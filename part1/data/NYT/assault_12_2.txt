He also fought code infraction battles with county officials over his brothels.He wrote a book titled "The Art of the Pimp," a play on Donald Trump's book "The Art of the Deal," and won election as a Republican to the state Assembly less than a month after his death.His campaign consultant, Chuck Muth, declined Friday to comment, saying the autopsy results spoke for themselves. Muth has said Hof didn't drink, smoke or use drugs.Advertisement
