To the Editor:Re “A Leading Jewish Philanthropist Is Accused of Sexual Harassment” (front page, March 21):Michael Steinhardt is a 78-year-old man who, by his own admission, engaged in degrading banter that he acknowledged was “boorish, disrespectful, and just plain dumb.” He apologized for his actions openly. As the article makes clear, there are no accusations that he ever forced, or even attempted, unwanted physical contact.And yet The Times devotes a coveted front-page slot and two full inside pages to the story. Isn’t that a bit of overkill? While we all do the very necessary work of eliminating sexual harassment and assault, we cannot create equivalencies between all people accused of wrongful talk and action. By running this story at this length, The Times does a disservice to the cause it has championed so valiantly.I fully acknowledge that I know Michael Steinhardt and that I consider him and his family to be friends. I have heard him make bawdy, personal comments, but while that is not appropriate, it was always clear he was doing so in jest. He should not be given a pass for his behavior, but nor should he be pilloried so disproportionately.Wendy BelzbergNew YorkAdvertisement
