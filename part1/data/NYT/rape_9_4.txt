These funds are also expected to go towards supporting victims' families. The commission held 14 public and thousands of closed-door hearings for people who suffered during the rule of Ben Ali and his predecessor Habib Bourguiba, Tunisia's first president, but said authorities had often refused to deal with the panel."STATE WITHIN A STATE"Tunisia's President Beji Caid Essebsi, who served under Ben Ali as parliamentary speaker, accused the IVD of acting like a "state within a state" and of increasing divisions instead of forging reconciliation. The IVD rejected such criticism."Presidential security prevented the commission from accessing the archives of the presidency," the IVD said in the report, which also accused Prime Minister Youssef Chahed of refusing to cooperate.The presidency and the government could not be immediately reached for comment on Tuesday on the IVD report.Despite the frustrations highlighted in the report, Tunisia remains the only Arab country to have transitioned smoothly to democracy since 2011, avoiding the wars that engulfed Libya and Syria or the authoritarian rule seen in Egypt.The North African country has won praise for a democratic transition since 2011, holding free elections and guaranteeing fundamental rights in a new constitution in contrast to turmoil and return of authoritarian rule in the region.The IVD said the rights violations it investigated had included rape, torture and financial crimes. Labour union members, Islamists and leftists were among the victims.Those accused of carrying out the rights abuses include police officers, judges and relatives of Ben Ali.($1 = 3.0064 Tunisian dinars) (Reporting By Tarek Amara; Editing by Ulf Laessing and Gareth Jones)Advertisement
