"This would be a good way to avoid the exhausting and destructive process of dealing with each case in court." The deepening abuse scandal in Chile last week led Pope Francis to accept the resignation of Archbishop of Santiago Ricardo Ezzati, the highest-ranking member of the Catholic Church in Chile.His replacement, Bishop Celestino Aos, said following Wednesday's court ruling that Chile's justice system was handling each accusation "case by case" but said he could not predict what might come next. Aos said those who feel violated should feel free to act, adding that the Church was seeking "truth, justice and reparation."Wednesday's unanimous appeal's court decision required the Archdiocese to pay 100 million pesos ($146,000) each for "moral damages" to Juan Carlos Cruz, Jose Andres Murillo and James Hamilton. The men accuse former Santiago parish priest Fernando Karadima of having sexually abused them decades ago, and the Church of having covered up that abuse.Aos said the Church would not appeal the ruling.Chilean investigators are investigating 158 allegations of sexual abuse or cover-up involving 241 victims, of which 123 were underage at the time of the abuse, according to the latest statistics from Chile's state prosecutor's office.
