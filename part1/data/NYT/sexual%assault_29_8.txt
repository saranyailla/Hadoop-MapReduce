He would do this five or six times a day," Hingst said outside court.Short told the court he did not recall breaking wind in Hingst's office, "but I may have done it once or twice."Hingst also accused Short of being abusive over the phone, using profane language and taunting him.The appeal judges found Hingst "put the issue of Mr. Short's flatulence to the forefront" of his bullying case, arguing that "flatulence constituted assaults."The court found that Short did not bully or harass Hingst. Hingst had failed to establish that Construction Engineering had been negligent.Hingst worked for Construction Engineering as a contract administrator from May 2008 until April 2009.He argues he was bullied in the workplace until his job was terminated.Construction Engineering argued his job was terminated because of a downturn in construction work due to the global financial crisis in late 2008.Advertisement
