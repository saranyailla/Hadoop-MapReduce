The Philadelphia Inquirer reports the location has become a sort of holding area for officers on restricted duty, meaning they are unfit for street duty because of pending criminal charges or accusations of wrongdoing.Among them is a homicide detective accused of making secret cash payments to an imprisoned informer and a former detective accused of coercing false confessions.Police Commissioner Richard Ross says that it's a low-risk way to get work from problem officers and that it has never caused problems.The American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania says a facility with highly sensitive information is the last place an officer accused of wrongdoing should be working.___Information from: The Philadelphia Inquirer, http://www.inquirer.comAdvertisement
