The mother exited to try to find out what was wrong with the car, authorities said.The boy took a gun from the car’s console and accidentally fired it while his mother was outside, striking his sister in the head, the sheriff’s office said.Emergency responders were called and took her to an Atlanta-area hospital. Two days later, detectives learned the girl had died, the sheriff’s office said.Detectives determined that no charges will be filed.“It’s just a really sad situation,” sheriff’s Sgt. Ashley Henson said Saturday morning. “Just based on all the evidence and the entire situation, we felt like charges were not warranted in this particular case.”Sheriff Gary Gulledge said that his officers’ “hearts break for this family, and we hope God puts his healing hands around them during this difficult time.”“We want to remind everyone to keep their firearms unloaded and secured in an area away from children to ensure that this never happens again,” Gulledge said in a news release.Trademark and Copyright 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
