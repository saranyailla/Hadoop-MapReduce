Netflix dropped its latest interactive offering You vs Wild on April 10 with all eight episodes available in one go. You vs Wild is fronted by British survivalist Bear Grylls who puts the power in the audience’s hands as they’re given the chance to make choices about the direction of the episodes. The series sees Grylls put to the test in some of the most inhospitable locations on the planet.Netflix has yet to confirm whether there will be another series of You vs Wild but as always a renewal is going to be based on the show’s viewing figures.Express.co.uk has contacted Netflix to find out whether You vs. Wild will be recommissioned for another series.However, producer Robert Butcha said about whether he wanted more episodes: “Totally. It was a real challenge, and there were times when I was pining for the days of the simple, linear, unscripted TV show producing. That being said, I really liked the challenge and I’d love to do more.”He added to Vulture: “There are so many places in the world where we could take Bear.”You vs Wild only landed last week and so the streaming giant will be waiting to see how the show performs before making a decision.Netflix famously does not release its ratings, so it’s impossible to know how well a series has performed.Generally, if a series is phenomenally successful it’s likely to be recommissioned fairly quickly like Sex Education and The Umbrella Academy which have both got the green light following their debut seasons.HOW MANY EPISODES ARE IN YOU VS WILD?If Netflix does give a second series the go-ahead, You vs Wild can be returning next year with another eight episodes.According to programme-makers, there were months of pre-production and each episode took five days to shoot.Season two is likely to see more of the same with Grylls going on more missions with the audience deciding how he’ll survive.Along with the missions, you will again help him to survive against the elements in the most brutal environments out there.CAN YOU KILL BEAR GRYLLS IN YOU VS WILD?You vs Wild is more of a game than a TV series in the traditional sense and follows on from the success of Black Mirror: Bandersnatch.Bandersnatch allowed you to make the narrative decisions but You vs Wild is non-fictional which makes it more akin to a computer game.You vs Wild got a PG rating, suggesting the series could be aimed more at younger viewers compared to Bandersnatch, which was very adult in theme and essentially allowed users to commit murder.There is no such feature in You vs Wild, Grylls can’t be killed regardless of the reckless and wrong decisions made by audience members.Previously, Netflix tried out interactive features in some of its other kids’ shows such as Puss in Boot.HOW DOES YOU VS WILD WORK?Netflix is likely to be monitoring how long viewers watch - or rather play - You vs Wild to assess where it goes next with its interactive programming as a whole.The success of Bandersnatch has led Netflix to look into more interactive shows but You vs Wild is very different from the Black Mirror episode, which means it could be aimed at a very different audience.The interactive episode worked well and fitted in well into the world of Black Mirror but whether it can succeed with other shows is yet to be seen.However, given Netflix subscribers sci-fi leanings, we could see another show within this genre featuring a choose-your-own-adventure.You vs Wild is available to watch on Netflix nowThis article contains affiliate links, which means we may receive a commission on any sales of products or services we write about.
