Jakarta: Joko Widodo is running late.The clock is slowly ticking towards 8.30pm and the Indonesian president, who on April 17 will ask 192 million voters to give him a second term, was due on stage at this East Jakarta sports and recreation hall a couple of hours ago.Replay Fans and a few free-standing air-conditioning units are trying and failing to hold back the tropical, late wet season heat while supporters of the president, near-universally known as Jokowi, chew on the free dinner packs handed out to everyone.The 2019 presidential election is effectively a referendum on Jokowi's first five years in office and his re-election pitch can be boiled down to this: "Stick with me and I'll deliver more of the same."By some measures, it seems to be working. The president holds a big lead in reputable opinion polls - in some cases, it runs to double digits.As Ben Bland, in a research paper published by the Lowy Institute this week, puts it: "Jokowi is the overwhelming front runner for the presidency ... it is hard to find a political expert who sees a viable path to victory for Prabowo [Subianto, his opponent]."But five years in power has taken some of the shine off the first person to rise to the presidency from outside Jakarta's political, business and military elite.Jokowi is no longer the cleanskin hope-and-change candidate of 2014, giddily hailed as "Indonesia's Obama" by some.  What would "more of the same" actually look like? And what has he achieved in his nearly five years in power?Infrastructure is the president's signature achievement.  He has overseen the construction of thousands of kilometres of roads, rail, seaports, airports and a desperately-needed underground train line (begun when he was Jakarta's governor) has opened in the capital in the last couple of weeks.He has attempted to extend access to healthcare and education, too, while economic growth has motored along at around five per cent - less than the seven per cent he promised, but respectable.Passengers on Jakarta's new Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system, which began operation this month.Credit:BloombergThe president and his supporters also tout an extremely popular program - begun before he came to power in 2014 - which has handed billions of dollars to Indonesia's 75,000 villages, and allowed them to make local investments in roads, sanitation and other local needs.A friend and ally of the president, who asks not to be named so he can speak freely, says the village program "gets to the heart of his priorities" and is "very boring, but hugely important on the ground".Balanced against that, the president has largely failed to stand up for human rights and minority groups, such as members of the LGBT community and religious groups such as Indonesia's Christians, in the face of a rising tide of Islamist intolerance.Hardly a week goes by without another case surfacing - from crosses on Christian graves being defaced, to a Buddhist woman being jailed for 18 months after complaining about the volume of the call to prayer from her local mosque, to 15-year-old topless mermaid statues suddenly being clothed at a Jakarta theme park to respect "Eastern values".Indonesian President Joko Widodo (left) with his running mate, conservative Muslim figure Ma'ruf Amin. Credit:APEven Jokowi has felt this pressure. His selection as his vice-presidential candidate of Ma'ruf Amin - a 76-year-old conservative cleric - highlights his determination to avoid being attacked, as he was in 2014, for not having a sufficiently Islamic outlook.He has done little to reform Indonesia's legal system, tackle corruption or reform the military, and the pace of economic reform has been slow.The Australian National University's Professor Marcus Mietzner says: "I think he has performed better on the international stage than initially feared ... he has largely put Indonesian foreign policy on auto-pilot, which has offered consistency and predictability to the country's international partners."Mietzner is, however, scathing of Jokowi's human rights record."He has been an all-around failure in the area of human rights and - especially - minority protections ... with former military leaders such as Wiranto and Hendropriyono in key executive and advisory positions, any meaningful progress in human rights became impossible."A low-key receptionIn the east Jakarta sports hall, deep inside opposition territory, the crowd is remarkably thin for a popular sitting president in a city that by some measures is home to as many as 30 million people.The hall has a capacity of 5000 but it's only three-quarters full. Organisers have asked people to move down from the bleachers to the floor seats so the crowd looks bigger for TV.The contrast with Prabowo's rallies - in which the populist, lectern-thumping  candidate is mobbed by tens of thousands of people wherever he goes - is stark.Prabowo Subianto speaks at the Gelora Bung Karno Stadium on April 7.Credit:APA few days earlier, somewhere between 150,000 and 200,000 people (the Prabowo campaign claimed a million) had turned up at the national stadium, Gelora Bung Karno in south Jakarta, to hear the challenger's fire-and-brimstone 40-minute pitch in which he railed against corruption, injustice, Indonesia being "raped" and the country's wealth being taken away by foreigners.Though Jokowi will have his own rally at the stadium come Saturday, Wednesday night's gathering is suburban retail politics at its most plain.The former Jakarta governor begins with a knowing joke about how the capital's infamous traffic caused his delayed arrival. Then it's down to business."What I would like to say first is that Jakarta is a mini-Indonesia. All ethnicities, all religions [live here]," he begins. "I respect the differences in Jakarta, that you have different religions, different cultures, but you are keeping unity ... I'm asking that we keep that unity ... don't let the presidential election disintegrate it."In 2014 we won 53 per cent of the vote in Jakarta. We want in 2019 a minimum of 55 per cent in Jakarta. If we can get 65 per cent, that's fine too," he says with a grin."We are now having a festival of democracy ... we don’t want a festival of democracy filled with threats, we want a festival of democracy filled with happiness."The president rails against political hoaxes spread by his opponent's supporters, which circulate like wildfire on social media and suggest that, for example, religious education will be scrapped in schools if Jokowi is re-elected or that the call to prayer from mosques will be cancelled.Indonesian President Joko Widodo during the presidential debate in February.Credit:BloombergThis sort of "black" campaigning was a feature of 2014, too, when rumours circulated that Jokowi was secretly a Christian, a communist, or ethnically Chinese. He reminds people that Ma'ruf is his running mate.The president then moves to one of his specific policies: three smart cards.The first is for university students, to help them with the cost of study; the second is a so-called pre-work card, which will help people looking for work with more training and a little bit of money; the third is targeted at low income households (housewives, to be precise) and will offer big discounts on basic food items such as rice, sugar and eggs.The details of how all three cards will actually function are still being worked out, and Jokowi says they won't be introduced until next year, if he is re-elected."Lastly, I’m asking you on April 17, please invite your friends and family to go to the polling station [and vote]. Agree?""Agree!" the crowd roars back.And that's it. The president's pitch is finished in 17 minutes and he makes his way from the stage.The lack of detail from both candidates on what they are actually promising voters, and what those promises will cost, is a striking feature of the campaign.Arya Fernandez, a researcher at Indonesia's prestigious Centre for Strategic and International Studies, says both men are running personality-focused campaigns.Depressingly, he also predicts that money politics - the practice of vote buying - will again play a part in this election: "Public tolerance of money politics is still high."Jokowi's comments about respecting different religions and cultures are a not-so-oblique reference to the role that religion, and specifically conservative Islam, is playing in this campaign.Andreas Harsono, a researcher for Human Rights Watch in Indonesia, says there are two schools of thought on why Jokowi has not more forcefully confronted the issue."One camp believes his hands are tied, and that no president has had to face this type of muscular Islamism as much as Jokowi has had to," he says."The second camp says it’s true that Jokowi’s position is weak, but he spent his political capital banning [extremist group] Hizb ut-Tahrir."Many minority groups don’t have much hope in Jokowi, but they [feel they] are hopeless with Prabowo."Sandiaga Uno, Prabowo's running mate,  takes a selfie with supporters during a campaign rally in Sragen, Central Java.Credit:BloombergIn an interview with Bloomberg this week, stung by criticism from former president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, Prabowo pushed back against the idea that he is overly reliant on Islamist supporters, insisting that he believes in an Indonesia that is multi-racial and multi-religious and pointing out that it is Jokowi who is running with a religious figure, while he had chosen businessman and former Jakarta deputy governor Sandiaga Uno for his ticket.Prabowo is a bundle of contradictions and hyperbole - the strong man who cares for the weak, the millionaire who cares for the poor, the onetime general in Suharto's military who champions democracy,  the leader who will bind the nation together while pitching to conservative Muslim voters. Jokowi, by contrast, is businesslike, transactional, outcomes-focused. Bland says Jokowi's "chief focus has always been on economic progress, not human rights and the principles of democracy".Mietzner predicts a win for the incumbent - though a closer contest than the polls suggest."[Jokowi] is likely to be remembered as the infrastructure president - not more, not less. Having said that, it is worth noting that many Indonesians care as little about the niceties of democratic quality as Jokowi does. For them, building roads and ports and keeping prices low is more than enough for a president to be considered a success."with Karuni RompiesJames Massola is south-east Asia correspondent, based in Jakarta.
