Police have no idea what the driver, who ditched their car at Sycamore Close, looks likePolice in Exeter have been forced to call off a large-scale search for a hit-and-run driver, because they don't know what they look like.A dramatic police chase involving Devon & Cornwall Police began on the A30 this afternoon.Police stopped the chase when the car involved, a blue Ford, arrived in residential Exeter - so members of the public would not be put at further risk.Around 10 minutes after the police aborted their pursuit, the car struck a member of the public and continued driving.The vehicle was ditched at Sycamore Close, off Sweetbrier Lane, and searches involving armed police and a NPAS (National Police Air Service) helicopter were carried out. Those searches have now been called off.A spokesperson for Devon & Cornwall Police explained:  "At the request of another police force we made efforts to stop a vehicle. That force told us a number of people could have been driving that particular car."Because officers do not know who they are looking for the search has been stood down."Enquiries continue, but there are limited things police can do without a description of the driver."The man hit by the car has escaped with minor injuries, with a possible concussion.It is thought there was a strong concern for the welfare of the driver which started the pursuit, and the car is not thought to have been stolen.Blankets have been seen in the back seat of the car, suggesting the occupant may have been sleeping inside.Two police logs apply to this incident, if you can help police with either contact them on phone number 101. The initial police pursuit is log 565. The hit and run is log 604
