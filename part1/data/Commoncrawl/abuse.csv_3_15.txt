What was the federal government thinking when it decided to gift grocery mega-giant Loblaws with $12 million dollars of borrowed money for which the taxpayers are on the hook? I get that it was a green scheme to induce businesses and organizations to make their operations more energy efficient and that any business or organization could apply. I suppose that's the first mistake right there, no limits on applicants. So any applicant, no matter how much they could afford it, could dip their hands into taxpayers pockets to save themselves from funding efficiencies themselves.That Loblaw can handily afford to pay for these business improvements is clear. They did smashing business last year posting a $3.25 billion profit, up 2.6 per cent from last year, beating analysts' predictions and increasing profits to shareholders. So clearly financial need wasn't a criteria.Neither was a history of ethical business practices. Much as been made lately of SNC-Lavalin and their lobbying for a deferred prosecution agreement for their years of corruption in the construction industry. An issue of concern was their potential lockout from government contracts for 10 years if they were found guilty in a criminal trial.And yet here we have Loblaw, a company involved in a 14-year long price-fixing scheme over bread, a staple product in the lives of every Canadian, winning a grant from the government, and not only that, but being the "model" recipient of this program. Sounds like a deferred prosecution agreement to me before they were even law. No one at Loblaws was charged in return for their co-operation. No one went to jail, those involved simply stopped working there.It boggles the mind. What was the government thinking? Do people in government not read the news? Did they not catch whiff of this boondoggle that cost the company maybe up to $150 million in gift cards as an apology to Canadian consumers? Did they not think that maybe this wasn't the best place to tout the program, at a Loblaws store? It's like washing our faces in the mud. Remember how these guys robbed you for years? Well, who cares? Here's more money. And let's not forget the pushback Galen Weston put to the increase in minimum wage legislation of the Liberal provincial government. That grand patriarch of the Weston family, whose net worth clocks in third with $13.55 billion according to a MacLean's report on the richest people in Canada in 2018, cried about lost jobs and increased food prices should Loblaw and its many affiliates be forced to pay their workers a living wage. It was a disgraceful show of special interest in favour of the One-Percenters, a complete out-of-reality position that demonstrated his fear of loss and his desperate need for profit to sustain his way of life in the top echelons of Canadian corporate society. Profit built on the backs of low paid and part-time workers, many of whom are women. And people ask: what gender pay gap? There is no doubt that some stores in the Loblaw family need work, like the one where I shop. I do not look forward to going into the store during the summer months when the freezers and the air conditioning combined create a near-Arctic environment for which I wish I had packed my parka. It's the summertime and the workers are wearing long sleeves and sweaters. It creates an unpleasant shopping experience as well as an unhealthy work environment. Never mind that I can calculate the energy costs myself and wonder how much I'm paying in higher food prices to keep up the cold. And that should be the company's motivation, to keep their operating costs down. To invest in the best, most green technology as a part of the way they do business, not motivated by a special grant from government. Paying the full cost of environmental upgrades should be part of their operations budget.What happened to corporate social responsibility and doing the right thing? Was Loblaw doing the right thing when they applied for the program knowing they could pay for it themselves. Knowing that there are more deserving, that is, less financially flush, applicants in the pool? Their shareholders would say yes, protecting their fiduciary interests in taking advantage of every opportunity to save costs. Taxpayers, who are facing a national debt of $671.25 billion, see it differently. They see it as a gross abuse of government funding. That the program exists to encourage environmental responsibility is great, how it is administered is disastrous if Loblaw is the poster child for success.The optics on this are not good. Neither is the reality.Margaret Shkimba a is a writer who lives in Hamilton. She can be reached at menrvasofia@gmail.com  or you can “Friend” her on Facebook and follow her on Twitter @menrvasofia
