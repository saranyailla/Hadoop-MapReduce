The ex-asylum closed in 1993 and is now a housing estate on the outskirts of CanterburyCreepy pictures taken by urban explorers show the derelict shell of the former St Augustine's Hospital before it was torn down.It was one of the country's most infamous asylums for more than a century before bulldozers moved in and demolished it in 1993.The site, near Chartham, was originally built to create a "therapeutic environment for mentally ill patients from across Kent" back in the 19th century, but it ran into controversy in the 1970s.It was known by a number of names: Kent County Lunatic Asylum (1875-1920), Kent County Mental Hospital (1920-1948) and finally St Augustine's Hospital (1948-1993).Almost 25 years after St Augustine’s Hospital shut its doors, the institution still remains a topic for much debate.The hospital provided shelter and work for many locals for over a century but one controversial inquiry left a stain on its reputation. The asylum officially opened its doors in 1876 when the Kent County Asylum at Barming Heath near Maidstone reached its full capacity. Take a chilling tour around the ex-asylum St Augustine's Hospital before it was knocked downInitially, it was expected to provide shelter and recreation to 870 patients but the hospital gradually expanded to become a self-contained village-within-a-village, housing almost 2000 people.By 1948, the asylum included 300 acres of a farm, 73 staff residences, workshops, a bakery, a butchery and a church.It provided crucial help to servicemen in the world wars and in 1969 one of its nurses, Barbara Bishop, was awarded an MBE after she rescued a suicidal patient on top of the roof of one of the facilities.Male patients worked on the farm while female patients either ran the laundry or were seamstresses.While high risk patients were looked after in single sex locked wards in the main building, low risk residents lived in houses within the grounds: Oak House housed short stay patients and Beech House catered for young people.But few would remember the hospital's accomplishments after the 1970s, when a report put together by University of Kent’s researcher William Ankers, who joined the hospital for a brief period, and nurse Olleste Weston uncovered a shocking list of abuse and neglect cases that took place within its walls.The pair informed the senior management of the hospital of their concerns but they were dismissed.They then put together a long report detailing 70 instances of abuse and neglect – forcing the health authority to set up an inquiry.The inquiry upheld most of the complaints, in particular the use of electroconvulsive therapy, which was widespread in the 1970s.They criticised senior staff, including doctors and nurses, but no disciplinary action was recommended.The hospital closed down in 1993 when changes were introduced to the care system.Following demolition of architecturally unremarkable buildings, the next 10 years witnessed a wholesale transformation of the site as a large part of it was redeveloped as a gated community of luxury flats and houses.Only the distant Oak House and it's neighbouring buildings remain untouched, awaiting firm plans.However the observant visitor will notice that many of the tree street names in the housing estate reference former wards (as with Magnolia Drive, Beech Avenue and Almond Court) and if you look carefully you can find converted original buildings, including both the water tower and the chapel.Do you want to stay up to date with everything that's happening across the county with Kent Live?Here's the link to our main Facebook page where we share our latest stories, including anything from breaking news to features, court coverage and much, much more.For What's On content such as the latest openings, events, and shopping news see here.And we have a specialist Facebook group covering traffic and travel across the south east, where we provide the latest updates from any incidents on the roads or trains.You can also follow Kent Live on Twitter here, as well as on our Instagram page where we share great pictures of Kent.For a round-up of the day's top stories direct to your inbox, subscribe to our newsletter here.
