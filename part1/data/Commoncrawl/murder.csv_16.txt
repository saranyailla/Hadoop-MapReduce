One of the victims was identified by the coroner as 59-year-old Olivia Enriquez of Sun Valley. The identity of the other victim has not yet been released by officials but is described as a man in his 50s.Three of the people in the Charger were taken to a local hospital with injuries including the 25-year-old female driver from Pacoima.The Los Angeles Police Department released a statement Saturday saying, “The driver of the white Dodge displayed a willful disregard for human life,” and that they intend to arrest her and book her for murder once she is released from the hospital.One male passenger sustained minor injuries and was later released from the hospital.The fourth person in that car, a man, fled the scene. He ran past the train tracks. Police were looking for him Friday night.The accident is being investigated as a hit-and-run.The Charger was traveling southbound on San Fernando. It was speeding and was also racing with another vehicle. It collided with the Corolla, knocking it 50 or 60 yards away from the scene — killing the two people in that car instantly from the impact.“They are not exactly sure what the cause of the collision is,” said LAPD Detective Meghan Aguilar. “But from talking with witnesses, speed will have played a factor in this and it possibly involves street racing between that white Dodge Charger and another dark sedan.”Police say the other sedan did not collide with any other vehicles so that sedan is not being looked at as a hit-and-run suspect but they are looking for the people in that car so they can get details about how it happened.The investigation was continuing for several hours Friday night.Police are asking that anyone with information is asked to contact the Los Angeles Police Department.Please log in using one of these methods to post your comment:
