Even by the standards of a line of work that can be dangerous, it was an unusually violent attack.A London woman was attacked with a stun gun and robbed early Monday, with her vehicle taken, by a man she’d met through an online advertisement, leaving police looking for a suspect and warning those involved in the sex trade to be wary.One women’s advocate said she’s worried the violence could be the fallout of a recent decision by London police to publish the names of johns, or men accused of buying sex.Jessie Rodger said she “had major concerns” about the recent police decision to start naming johns, because there’s peer-reviewed evidence that approach will increase violence and decrease the safety of sex workers.“I don’t know if there is any way for us to know, but this will always come up for me and for our organization to wonder when violence happens toward sex workers, if this is part of it,” said Rodger, executive director of Anova, an organization that provides support and shelter to victims of sexual violence and abuse.London police were looking for a suspect in the assault, which happened shortly after midnight Monday at a home in the area of Wellington and Simcoe streets, just south of the downtown.The new police practice to publicly name men accused of buying sex makes the men reluctant to give their names when trying to meet sex workers, Rodger said. Men who trade in fake names stop sex trade workers from being able to speak to one another about potential clients to assess their own safety.“If they give a fake name, (the workers) don’t know,” Rodger said. “Their ability to vet is down.”Police, who weren’t immediately available for followup questions about the implications of the attack, say a man went to the home after communicating with a woman through an online ad.Hand-held stun guns, which deliver a jolt of electricity, are prohibited weapons in Canada, their use legally restricted to law enforcement agencies.The woman in Monday’s attack had minor injuries and didn’t seek any medical attention, police said.Police Chief John Pare recently changed the city police policy about naming johns, a move to help fight human trafficking in the sex trade.London police previously had withheld the names of accused johns, even in human trafficking investigations, saying most would avoid a criminal record by attending a diversion program to educate them about the pitfalls of the sex-trade industry.Decades of research shows that naming johns puts sex trade workers at risk, a London sex-work researcher has said.“I don’t know how the decision was made. It is a perfect illustration of ignoring research in favour of moralizing,” said Treena Orchard, a health studies researcher at Western University, told The Free Press earlier this year.Worried about being named, johns will take sex workers to more isolated or hidden places. Sex workers facing a declining number of clients will be forced to lower their prices, work longer hours or take greater risks with unknown johns.Rodger said she’s received several alerts about men who are threats to sex-trade workers over the last few months.“This one is a little more concerning and violent, but I wouldn’t say its super-uncommon,” she said. “(I have) absolute concern for women who participate in sex work, absolute concern on how we support and we make sure they are safe.”In a statement Monday, SafeSpace London, a collective of sex workers and advocates for the decriminalization of prostitution, said getting warned about a violent predator “is great,” but much more is needed to make their working conditions safer.“We need decriminalization,” the group said in its statement. “It is a first and essential step, while we address the other systemic issues that reduce the likelihood someone is in sex work from a place of consent.”Police described the suspect in Monday’s attack as black, between 25 and 40 years of age, about five-foot-eight and 200 pounds, with short hair. Police say he was clean-shaven and wore a black and grey toque and a black hooded sweatshirt.The vehicle reported stolen in Monday’s attack is a 2019 red Toyota RAV4, with licence plate CHDY928.Anyone with information is asked to contact London police at 519 661-5670.— With files by Randy Richmondhrivers@postmedia.comTwitter.com/HeatheratLFP365 Bloor St East, Toronto, ON, M4W3L4, www.postmedia.com
