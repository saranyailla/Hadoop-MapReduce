Listed building is in a conservation area on New North RoadPlanners are set to rule shortly on whether an imposing Grade II listed building in Highfields can be transformed into 33 luxury apartments.Brothers Andrew, Nicholas and Simon Mear, owners of San Pedro Properties, bought Highfields, the Grade II listed former Huddersfield College building at New North Road, in a £1.25m deal last year.They want to convert the former Kirklees College Buildings into residential apartments which they claimed would safeguard the building's future.The vast property, built in 1839 at a cost of £5,000 has very distinctive features with a stunning castle battlement-style parapet.Originally, it was a boys’ grammar school before becoming Huddersfield College in 1909.In 1975 it became part of Huddersfield Technical College and more recently housed Kirklees College’s performing arts department.The building stands at the junction of New North Road and Highfield Road – not far from the former technical college complex, which has been left empty since Kirklees College moved to its Waterfront campus at Manchester Road.The application says the proposed conversion of the former Kirklees College Buildings into residential apartments will safeguard their future retention.Space Architecture of Linthwaite say in their application for listed building consent which will include demolition of link canopy, partial demolition of link building, erection of additional storey to link building, and internal and external alterations:"Furthermore, the proposed external changes will, in a number of areas, return the buildings to something closer to their original appearance."Changes to the original internal fabric will be modest and there will be no changes at all to key internal elements such as the roof trusses and original stairs."Changing the buildings to residential use will be consistent with the dominant existing pattern of building use in the surrounding area and will therefore enhance the ambience of this part of the conservation area."A spokesman for Space said they hoped to hear within four to five weeks' time whether their application was successful.
