Despite a production that included 24 singers in church choir robes, dancers, and a terrifically talented band, Glover mesmerized with his vocals, raps, dancing and banter.It was hard to look away, and that’s the mark of a great performance, isn’t it?Yes. Yes, it is, and from the moment he appeared  — shirtless, in white pants, high above the crowd on a lift at the end of a 40- or 50-yard walkway that extended from the stage — opening in the show with “Atavista” and then “Algorithm,” you could tell he’d come to Coachella to push all his chips in.“This is not a concert,” Gambino said after those first few songs. “This is church. If you want to hear your favorite song, go home and do that.”Hip-hop is really too limiting a tag for the music Glover makes, incorporating as he does plenty of soul and R&B on numbers like light and breezy “Summertime Magic” or the P-Funk darkness of a number like “Boogieman,” which arrived after a mid-set blast of fireworks high above the stage..His acting background surely helps make his performances even more compelling, whether he’s joking around with a fan in the crowd when he hopped down to share a joint at one point, or whether he’s doing the herky-jerky dance style you might have seen in the video for his Grammy-winning song- and record of the year, “This Is America,” one of the highlights of the final run of his show.“I feel like I love you — a lot,” he said by way of introducing the song “Riot,” a number he dedicated to people in his life he’d lost in the last year, from the recent murder of Nipsey Hussle and the overdose death of Mac Miller to the death of his own father.A cover of Gnarls Barkley’s “Crazy” slipped into “Terrified,” and then the feel-good vibes of “Feels Like Summer.” A new number — no name given — got him to “This Is America,” after which he ran off stage, swigged something from a bottle of clear liquid, and hugged main stage predecessor Janelle Monáe, whose lips you could read telling him, “You are amazing.”He was, and his final numbers including “Sober” and “Redbone” only underscored that. But Monáe was amazing in her own set, too, which focused on her terrific 2018 album “Dirty Computer,” and celebrated the diversity of love and the power of women.Monae played a set very similar to the one she delivered at Music Tastes Good in Long Beach last fall. The stage was a little bigger, the costumes slightly different, but the songs were more or less the same.But she’s so good who could complain? Not me, and this is the third time I’ve seen her in less than a year. Songs such as “Pynk” and “Yoga” are both sensual and thought-provoking. “I Got The Juice” is an exhortation to celebrate your own special essence, through music, through dance, through whatever got you the juice you got. Where she brought fans on stage to demonstrate their dance moves and “juice” in Long Beach last year, here she invited out Saturday performer Lizzo and Friday’s Tierra Whack to trade dance moves with her.Both Monae and Gambino share a sensibility that celebrates freedom and independence and being true to yourself no matter what society at large might want to push down upon you.On Friday, they pushed back, and the crowd danced and sang, everybody celebrated the juice that makes Coachella fun but also sometimes great.Get the latest news delivered daily!
