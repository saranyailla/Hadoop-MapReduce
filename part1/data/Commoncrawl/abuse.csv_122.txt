I believe that a good leader would recognize that moment and step down,” he added.DePerro argued that Malone’s resignation was especially necessary in light of the diocese’s publicized list of diocesan clerics who were accused of sexual abuse or misconduct, which he said demonstrated that the diocese has not been transparent or honest in its handling of sexual abuse allegations under Malone’s leadership.Malone’s alleged scandals also led, in part, to federal and state investigations of abuse cover-ups in the diocese.“With the disclosure of this list and the number of things that continue to come out, that the diocese has not been transparent with the public, I believe that moment has come,” he said.Advertisement - story continues below“I know the bishop had come forward with a period of prayer and healing, but those things do not seem to be working as this continues to unfold.”Malone has apologized for his failures but has also refused other demands for his resignation and said that he will remain as the bishop of the diocese until his retirement in 2021.
