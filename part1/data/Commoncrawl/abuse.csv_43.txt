Prime Minster Justin Trudeau (L) and Ontario Premier Doug Ford. File Photos Whatever their angry rhetoric aimed at each other leading up to the Oct. 21 federal election, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Ontario Premier Doug Ford have something in common.They both misled voters on their plans to eliminate the deficit and balance their governments’ books during the election campaigns that brought them to power with majority governments.That politicians with such opposing views — led by Trudeau’s belief in a carbon tax and Ford’s legal challenge of it in Ontario — ended up in the same place on deficits and balanced budgets, suggests a reality of modern politics.That is that election promises by any political leader in Canada on eliminating deficits should be viewed with skepticism.During the lead-up to the June 7 Ontario election, Ford never released a costed financial platform but said he would balance the province’s books during his four-year term of office, probably by the third year.On May 16, Ford said that because he would not take a “slicing and dicing” approach to eliminating the deficit: “We aren’t going to wipe out the deficit the first year, even maybe the second … We’re going to make sure that we run a responsible government, a respectful government, to the taxpayers. It’s probably going to take a year or two.”But in his first budget Thursday, Ford said it will now take him five years to balance the books, projecting a $300-million surplus in 2023-24, assuming the premier and the Progressive Conservatives win the Ontario election on June 2, 2022, which of course is not a given.Trudeau, during the 2015 election campaign, predicted three years of “modest” federal deficits leading to a balanced budget with a $1-billion surplus in his final year in office in the 2019-20 fiscal year.In his March budget, Trudeau, having blown every one of his deficit predictions to date, projected a $19.6-billion deficit in 2019-20, with no plan to eliminate federal deficits in sight.Many economists consider a government’s debt-to-GDP ratio a more accurate indicator of its commitment to fiscal discipline, or lack of it.Ford spent the entire election campaign describing Wynne’s time in office as a financial train wreck, including a 37.6% debt-to-GDP ratio in its final year of office if you believe her numbers, 40.5% if you believe the panel Ford hired postelection to assess the Liberal government’s books.That compares to what then-premier Kathleen Wynne’s Liberals said would be a healthy debt-to-GDP ratio of 27%, which they promised to achieve eventually without explaining how before losing the election.Ford’s budget now predicts his government’s debt-to-GDP ratio will be higher than Wynne’s at 40.7%, this year and next, and 40.6% in 2021-22.In the 2015 federal election, Trudeau predicted Canada’s debt-to-GDP ratio would fall from 30% in 2016-17 to 27% in 2019-20 under his leadership.Trudeau’s Liberal budget for 2019-20 now predicts his government’s debt-to-GDP ratio for this fiscal year will be 30.7%.Deficits and debt are essentially unpaid taxes, unpaid interest to service the debt and future cuts to public services, especially damaging if governments increase them to irresponsible levels.The lesson from the 2018 Ontario election and the 2015 federal election is that promises of political leaders to balance the budget should be taken with a huge grain of salt, regardless of their ideologies.lgoldstein@postmedia.comtwitter.com/sunlorrieWe encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts.
