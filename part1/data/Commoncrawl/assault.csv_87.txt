WINSLOW — A Camden County elementary school teacher has been charged with trying to meet up with a 14-year-old girl for sex.Jonathan Liano, 38, of the Sicklerville section, was arrested Friday when he showed up in Pennsauken about 4:30 p.m., where cops were there to greet him.Prosecutors said Liano thought he was going to meet up with the girl, who actually was a fake persona created by an undercover detective with the Camden County Prosecutor’s Office High-Tech Crimes Unit. Investigators said Liano traded sexually explicit messages with the person who Liano thought was underage.Liano is at least the second government employee this month to be charged with luring after an undercover sting.
