							videoDebbie Bartowick with the Forever Friends Foundation told Fox 8: ‘The injuries are straight cuts to both ears.’‘It appears like somebody used scissors or shears.’Bartowick said that she has never witnessed such extreme animal abuse, however she did receive multiple mistreated cats from the same area last year.Authorities said the injured cat was found on a neighbors porch on Cleveland’s west side Friday morning.The unnamed neighbor called the Forever Friends Foundation and comforted the cat until rescue workers arrived.Surgery was performed that afternoon to mitigate the animal’s pain and prevent infection.Both ears needed to be amputated, but the cat is reportedly recovering successfully.Dr Harmander Sandhu said that it was obvious thay the injuries were caused by a person, not another animal.‘It’s very unfortunate for a poor animal, which can’t speak and can’t say anything, and went through all of that pain,’ he said.The Forever Friends Foundation payed for the treatment with donations and said the cat will be put up for adoption eventually.He’s very social. You can pet him. He trusted somebody, and how horrible it must have been for somebody to do that and the pain he felt,’ Bartowick said.
