Complaints are being handled in the usual way.'The Labour Party takes all complaints of anti-Semitism extremely seriously and we are committed to challenging and campaigning against it in all its forms.Lord Falconer (left) was appointed by Mr Corbyn to review Labour´s complaints process. The leader was heard saying he worried that alleged anti-Semitism was being ignored in a meeting with Margaret Hodge (right)'All complaints about anti-Semitism are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures and any appropriate disciplinary action is taken.'Referring to the recording, a Labour Party source said: 'Before Jennie Formby became general secretary, we were alarmed that at times it seemed that former compliance unit staffers were targeting Jewish activists not in breach of rules, while obstructing action on clear-cut cases of anti-Semitism.'But Corbyn's comments came a year into Formby's tenure. It emerged last week that Formby had secretly suspended an official accused of being a whistleblower on Labour's handling of racism.The news surfaced as Corbyn was busy arguing that the UK should block any attempt to extradite WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange. The recorded remarks came a year into the tenure of the party's general secretary Jennie Formby (pictured with Jeremy Corbyn)The junior Labour Party staff member was stripped of their security pass and escorted off the headquarters on Tuesday.It came after leaked emails revealed that Corbyn had failed to discipline hundreds of party members accused of anti-Semitism.  One senior source said that the whistleblower might have committed criminal offences.But the person they identified to The Times was not the paper's whistleblower on Corbyn's latest remarks. And the party member's suspension means that there are now no permanent staff members dealing with alleged racism and misogyny. The party has seconded two members of Corbyn's office to the complaints unit team.Last night a Labour MP told the paper it was 'sickening' that the party leader spent the week defending an alleged rapist as a whistleblower, only to crack down on whistleblowing in his own party. They added that his hypocrisy knows no bounds. Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group
