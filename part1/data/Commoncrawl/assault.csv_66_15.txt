Nick Bullock, previously sentenced as an adult to life in prison for the murder of his 14-year-old cousin Brayton Bullock, was released on a plea deal in February after the Court of Appeal tossed the verdict on legal technicalities.Bullock pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter and was sentenced to the 13 years he had already served in prison. He is now a free man. While serving time for the murder, Bullock was moved around to several prisons, and was eventually moved to a prison in Quebec. He was charged with assaulting a peace officer March 14, 2018. In court last week, Bullock stood at the front of the court and told the judge that, on advice from his lawyer, he would like to transfer the case back to Quebec. The case will be back in Barrie May 6, when the paperwork for the transfer is expected to be completed.
