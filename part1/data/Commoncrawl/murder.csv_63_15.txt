	SCRANTON — The temperature in Scranton just after midnight hovered near 70 degrees — not bad for the dead of night, especially in mid-April.
	“That’s pretty impressive,” AccuWeather meteorologist Tom Kines said.
	So was what happened next.
	When a strong cold front moving eastward from the Ohio Valley collided with the warm, moist air hanging over Northeast Pennsylvania early Monday morning, the result was powerful thunderstorms with heavy rain, damaging winds and the kind of spectacular lightning display usually reserved for sultry summer nights.
	“If you have two different air masses colliding with each other, there is going to be a price to pay, and that price in this case was severe weather,” Kines said. “It’s not all that unusual as you get into April and May, but, yeah, that front that moved through had some punch to it.”
	Kines said the ingredients were in place for an unsettled outcome.
	Although it had been warm for a couple of days, the second half of the weekend added humidity to the equation, making conditions by Sunday evening seem almost summery, he said. At the same time, the air mass behind the cold front was “considerably cooler.”
	National Weather Service records show the temperature at the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport dropped a full 10 degrees — from 69 to 59 — between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m.
	“Any time you have clashes of warm and cold air, you’re asking for trouble,” Kines said.
	Northeast Pennsylvania could see another battle between warm and cool air when a second strong cold front comes through the area Friday, he said.
	“It’s kind of a similar situation to what we just went through so it’s not out of the question that there is at least the potential for severe weather again later Friday or Friday night,” Kines said.
