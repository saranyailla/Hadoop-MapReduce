(THE CANADIAN PRESS/HO-RCMP) As the weather warms, even the most fearless smugglers have given up running snowmobiles hauling sleds loaded with contraband tobacco through the night and are preparing their high-powered boats to take over the task.But there was nothing in Ontario Finance Minister Vic Fedeli’s budget on Thursday to change or combat any of this — no extra enforcement, no tough restrictions and no zeroing in on known players.Upwards of 40% of the province’s smokers — but 80% of them in Fedeli Country around North Bay — buy contraband to support their habit, the resulting annual tax revenue loss to the province being a whopping $800 million.But, search “contraband” as a keyword in the budget document and it does not come up multiple times as would be expected with a Progressive Conservative government bent on tightening the books and finding money.The word “contraband,” in fact, doesn’t come up at all.

There is a lot of money to be made in contraband cigarettes, and illegal manufacturers are willing to pay premium money for off-season tobacco.This is why the waters along the banks of the St. Lawrence circling Cornwall Island, home of the Akwesasne Mohawk reserve as well as many of the active tobacco runners, is almost constantly abuzz with night-time activity — sled-drawn snowmobiles in winter and fast-running john boats in summer.The modus operandi is simple. An 18-wheeler hauling 34,000 pounds of raw-leaf tobacco purchased at $2 a pound in Virginia is off-loaded into garbage bags — or “smurfed” — on the American side of a reserve to be smuggled across the border by snowmobile or by boat to then make its way to unlicensed cigarette manufacturers on the Kahnawake Mohawk reserve near Montreal.Winter brings about premium money for smugglers because the tobacco-growing season in Ontario has not yet begun. That $2 per pound load from that tractor-trailer can now fetch smugglers $15 per pound from illicit cigarette manufacturers.In mid-March, the Cornwall Regional Task Force, a joint-force headed by the RCMP, intercepted snowmobiles hauling sleds loaded with 1,000 kilos, or 2,200 pounds, of raw-leaf tobacco and arrested three.To these alleged smugglers, that 2,200 pounds would have represented a one-run payday of upwards of $30,000 in tax-free cash.One pound of raw leaf can make 500 cigarettes, or 25 packs of 20.A pack of cigarettes purchased legitimately at your local Mac’s, for example, can run upwards of $15 depending on brand, of which 68% of the price is federal and provincial taxes.So, it’s a money-maker for government. Ontario, for example, had $1.2 billion in tobacco-tax revenue last year.Because of the high taxation, however, it is also a big money-maker for those in the contraband cigarette business who sell a carton of smokes for as little $30 tax-free and a baggie of 200 for as little as $8, compared to a legitimate carton of 10 packs that costs $130 or more.That is why smoke shacks proliferate every reserve in Ontario, including the reserves around Vic Fedeli’s home riding in North Bay.But even a relatively small diversion of tobacco is no small matter.For example, go back to the three arrested near Cornwall for attempting to smuggle 2,200 pounds of raw tobacco across the border behind their snowmobiles.If they had not been caught, and the tobacco not seized, then the first steps would have successfully been made towards the end result of taxpayers being deprived of cigarette tax revenues running north of $3.5 million.Yet contraband never came up in Fedeli’s budget.
