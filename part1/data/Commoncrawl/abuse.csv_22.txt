he remained in the Ecuadorean embassy to avoid previous extradition hearings concerning claims of rape and abuse in Sweden.'A kneejerk response that presumes that hacking is acceptable if the perpetrators can claim that their motives were journalistic is particularly dangerous when it emanates from those aspiring to become prime minister or home secretary, such as Jeremy Corbyn and Diane Abbott.'Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry tweeted: 'Why weren't Swedish authorities told in advance of Assange's ejection from Ecuadorian embassy, as the US clearly was?'Our priority should be the 2 alleged victims of sexual violence in Sweden & not a ruse to get him extradited to the US as a whistleblower.'Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group
