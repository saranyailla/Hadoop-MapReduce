Isaac Williams was murdered during an unprecedented run of killings in LeicestershireCatherine Williams will visit her son's grave this month to mark the second anniversary of his death, and to mourn him as a victim of Britain's deadly knife culture.Just 20 years old and shaping up as a talented amateur boxer, Isaac Williams was murdered at a time of heightened anxiety about knife crime in Leicester and the wider county.For reasons which still remain unclear, on Friday, April 21, 2017, Isaac was dragged from the street and bundled into a car.He was driven around for a while before one of his two abductors stabbed him in the leg.Grievously injured, Isaac was dumped in Cropthorne Avenue, Crown Hills and left for dead.Someone spotted him and called an ambulance, but he died in hospital a few days later.Now, his mum has added her voice to the clamour for action against knife violence here in Leicester and across the country.She lost her boy during an unprecedented series of killings in Leicester and Leicestershire.Before the end of May that year, Leicestershire Police had opened 11 murder or manslaughter investigations, eight of them involving blades.Essentially, that was an average year's death toll in the space of five months.Although knife crime has since fallen, Catherine, 51, is part of a wider movement of parents who have lost loved ones who want action to tackle the wave of violence.While some believe in stiffer penalties, she believes investment in things such as youth clubs as well as education are crucial.She said: "I am always thinking of my son, but it does get harder as the anniversary gets closer."He is on my mind a lot more. He is at Gilroes Cemetery and we will go as a family to see him on the anniversary."I am doing what I can to help the campaign against knife crime here in Leicester"Our message is very simple. "It is 'drop the knives'. You are never going to achieve anything in your life because you carried a knife."Sometimes it feels like there's no hope for the young people nowadays."They are finding themselves in this position where they have nothing to do. This madness has to stop."We need to think about the effect of all the cuts on things like youth clubs has had on our young people."Isaac was a very good boy. He would always help me around the house and would dance and sing to me when I needed cheering up."I miss him very much every day. My other son Nathan, who is 21 now, is my rock and he will help me get through this."Two men were jailed for their roles in Isaac's death.Reuben Stretton and Devan Garner, both of no fixed address, had claimed they had acted in self-defence and that Isaac had been the aggressor during the car trip.However, a jury at Leicester Crown Court rejected their claims following a trial in November 2017.During their trial, the jury was told that Stretton and Garner forced Isaac into a car when they spotted him in the Humberstone area of the city on the day of the murder.They drove him to Cropthorne Avenue, where Stretton stabbed him in the left thigh with a 20cm blade.The court heard that Stretton then took the Peugeot to a car wash, and it was later found burned out.Stretton, then aged 20, insisted however that Isaac got into the vehicle voluntarily, and that, when they got to the car park, it was Isaac who produced a knife.He started brandishing it in a way that Stretton found "particularly alarming", Stretton's lawyers claimed, and was then stabbed.The court heard that the pair carried out the attack several months after Stretton had been stabbed by a group of men.Although Isaac had played no role in that assault, Stretton - who was said to have been suffering post-traumatic stress disorder as a result – targeted him because he believed he was friends with the brother of one of those who had been involved.Both Stretton and Garner, who was 19 at the time, were given life sentences and were ordered to serve a minimum 19 years behind bars.We want you to be able to get your news whenever and however you want it.As well as our website, we have a Facebook page, a Twitter feed, @leicslive, and for a daily snapshot of the top stories, you can sign up to receive our newsletters.If you prefer to use an app, we've got apps for both Android and Apple devices which can be tailored to deliver the news and sport that you're interested in.And if you download our app, you can sign up for push notifications, which means you'll get alerts about the biggest breaking news stories.We’ve also got Facebook groups for traffic and travel, crime, things to do with the kids, shopping and homes for sale.
