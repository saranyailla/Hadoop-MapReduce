But it isn't for the teen's death.Deputies arrested Teresa “Alex” Selgado Thursday afternoon in Flagler Beach and charged her with possession of LSD. Selgado was uncooperative during the arrest, deputies said.Deputies said they want to talk with her about the death of Curtis Gray, on Saturday and she's not considered a suspect.TRENDING NOW:Deputies said Marion Gavins Jr. shot and killed Gray at a strip mall off of Belle Terre Parkway after an argument.Gavins, 17, of Palm Coast, faces a first-degree murder charge in connection with the shooting death of Gray, the Sheriff’s Office said.Investigators said Gavins traveled to the Sheriff’s Office with his mother to surrender.Deputies said Gray was shot shortly after 12:30 a.m. Saturday at Palm Coast Laundry on Belle Terre Parkway.Gray was flown to a hospital, where he died, deputies said.“Our detectives worked swiftly and strategically to solve this murder investigation and were able to take Gavins Jr. into custody without anyone else getting hurt,” Sheriff Rick Staly said.Staly said he wants the State Attorney's Office to charge Gavins as an adult."This is a tragedy for two families -- one who lost a son who was an aspiring athlete, and the other, whose son will likely spend the rest of his life in prison or face the death penalty,” he said.Gray was a senior at Flagler Palm Coast High School, where he ran track and played football. He would have graduated in fewer than 45 days."We have a family who (was) anxiously preparing for graduation day, less than six weeks away. Now, they are preparing for a funeral," Superintendent James Tager said. "Curtis would talk about his faith with our athletic director, and our athletic director believes he will be in heaven."Gray's slaying was the first this year in the county. Counselors were on hand at school Monday to help teachers and students deal with their grief."When we see the life of one of our young people taken like this, it's especially tough," Tager said. "We must not, as a community, get used to the violent loss of life of our young people."This is a very sad day for the families of those involved and we are following all leads to find out exactly what happened. https://t.co/WwmHMdIe5uDOWNLOAD: Free WFTV News & Weather AppsNot near a TV?
