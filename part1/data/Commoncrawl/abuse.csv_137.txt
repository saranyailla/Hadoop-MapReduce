All complaints about anti-Semitism are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures and any appropriate disciplinary action is taken.“Because I was concerned that evidence was either being mislaid, ignored or not used and that there had to be some better system.”The Labour leader also said he had been the target of abuse, according to the newspaper.It reported Mr Corbyn as saying: “You see, I get a huge amount of abusive stuff, mostly, some of it’s quite threatening, you know, murder and stuff.”A Labour spokesman said the party takes allegations of anti-Semitism seriously.He said: “This shows Jeremy Corbyn’s desire to make procedures as robust and efficient as possible and to rebuild trust with the Jewish community.“We don’t comment on staffing matters. Complaints are being handled in the usual way.Lord Falconer was appointed by Mr Corbyn to review Labour’s complaints process (PA)“The Labour Party takes all complaints of anti-Semitism extremely seriously and we are committed to challenging and campaigning against it in all its forms.“All complaints about anti-Semitism are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures and any appropriate disciplinary action is taken.”Referring to the recording, a Labour Party source said: “Before Jennie Formby became general secretary, we were alarmed that at times it seemed that former compliance unit staffers were targeting Jewish activists not in breach of rules, while obstructing action on clear-cut cases of anti-Semitism.”- Press AssociationMore on this topicBig names from art world in the picture for Easter auctionShould you buy… the Rokit IO Pro 3D?Focus on Raheem Sterling as Manchester City beat TottenhamFoden takes City back to the top with hard-fought win over SpursReceive our lunchtime briefing straight to your inboxMore in this SectionPope Francis laments ‘all the crosses of the world’Boy, six, injured in ‘reckless’ shotgun attack on Wolverhampton houseDonald Trump blasts ex-advisers who claimed he tried to stop Mueller reportCalifornian parents who tortured and abused children given life sentencesLifestyle5 chocolate-themed breaks to satisfy sweet-toothed travellersThe Currabinny Cooks: Your guide to an easy EasterMichelle Darmody: Baking eggs for EasterDon’t let the grass grow under your feet: Lawnmowers that make the cutMore From The Irish Examiner
