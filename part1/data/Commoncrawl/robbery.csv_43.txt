The 'gang of four' were transported to Tasmania for 10 years - but never came backJust over 170 years ago, four Huddersfield women were transported to Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania) after they were convicted of robbing a man. Andrew Robinson reports.They were described by one newspaper as 'nymphs of the pave', a common term in the 1840s for a prostitute.Lydia Clay, also known as Lindley Lydia; Elizabeth Quarmby, Mary Ann Wentworth and Ruth Richardson were working women in the slums of Victorian Huddersfield; their lives of crime came to an abrupt end when they were transported to the penal colony on Van Diemen's Land in 1846.The four had been found guilty of taking advantage of a young man from Honley, George Boothroyd, who had naively decided to see a little of life in Huddersfield after cashing a cheque for £23 18s 6d for his father, a wealthy manufacturer.He made his way onto Castlegate which was known for its ale-houses, slum housing and brothels. He ended up having too much to drink and was robbed of his money in the Green Dragon Inn.Later, accompanied by a constable, he pointed out the women he claimed had taken his money. They denied the charges, claiming George had spent all his money on ale but was too embarrassed to tell his father.The accused were Lydia Clay, 36, Ruth Richardson, 28, Elizabeth Quarmby, 23, and Mary Ann Wentworth, who was 19 - also known as the Huddersfield Four.All four were sentenced to 10 years transportation, arriving in Van Diemen's Land on August 29 1846 on the vessel Sea Queen.None of them ever returned to their homeland.Their stories have now been told by TC Creaney of the Tasmania-based Female Convicts Research Centre which promotes interest in the female convicts of Tasmania.The Huddersfield Four were among 12,500 female convicts who were transported to Tasmania between 1803 and 1853, mainly for theft.TC Creaney discovered that Lydia Clay was born in 1811, one of six daughters.She was described as being 5ft tall and having a dark complexion and black eyes.Lydia Clay's first three years in the colony were turbulent, according to TC Creasey. She was constantly in trouble for misconduct, insubordination, insolence, refusing to work and being absent without leave.This behaviour may have been deliberate as female convicts would sometimes commit a crime in order to get sent back to the Cascades Female Factory, a workhouse for women.Lydia was sentenced to six months' hard labour at the factory after she was found in bed with James Schofield, a drayman, whom she married after completing the sentence.Clay was widowed when James was tragically killed in an act of manslaughter in 1854. She later married John Rees, a sailor. Her 'mourning' time was almost exactly one year which was common practice in England.She was granted her certificate of freedom in December 1855, ten years after her conviction, but died from an abscess on the brain less than three years later, aged 48.Ruth Richardson was 29 when she arrived in Van Diemen's Land. Her father had also been transported to the colony for 14 years for larceny in 1837.There were no offences on her record during her time on the island. She married a farmer called Thomas Sutton and, despite being 36, gave her age as 21 on the marriage certificate - the same age as her husband.Ruth Richardson died of tuberculosis a few weeks before Lydia Clay, on September 25 1858, at the Colonial Hospital in Hobart. She was 41.Elizabeth Quarmby was 23 when she arrived in Van Diemen’s Land. She married Thomas Parkinson, a tailor who had been a convict, in 1853. The couple had three children but their marriage failed and it appears that Elizabeth may have been a heavy drinker.Her husband placed a notice in a newspaper in 1864 declining responsibility for his wife's debts. He later remarried and was prosecuted for bigamy, receiving a three month jail sentence.Elizabeth died at the aged of 72 of 'senile decay' in February 1893. She was buried in a pauper’s grave.Mary Ann Wentworth, who had lived with her sisters in a workhouse from the age of around 13, lived her life on the penal colony without incident.She married Joseph Besemore, the owner of a store in Hobart where she was bookkeeper, in 1848, and went on to adopt two children. Her husband died in 1864 and 13 years later Mary Ann, aged 50, married 71-year-old widower John Dunbabin, a landowner and former politician.After he died in 1897, Mary Ann lived a comfortable life until her death in 1911 at her residence at New Town, Hobart, aged 86. She left a substantial estate.According to Nichola Garvey, a doctoral student at Australia's National Centre of Biography, the women had made better lives for themselves than those they had left behind."These women, the Huddersfield Four, managed to carve out independent lives for themselves in the Tasmanian colony."Each married, none appears to have engaged in prostitution, and none was convicted of stealing or swindling."For this reason it could be argued that their lives and prospects were better in Tasmania than in Huddersfield, notwithstanding the separation from friends and family."Of the four, perhaps only Elizabeth Quarmby failed to find a measure of peace in her life or comfort in her old age."TC Creaney - writing on the website www.femaleconvicts.org.au - believes the Huddersfield Four probably had better lives than they could have expected in England."Lydia seems to have been an out and out rebel, repeatedly offending during her sentence, then suffering the death of her first husband in such tragic circumstances. She herself died at a young 48."Elizabeth lost control of her life through alcohol, losing her marriage and probably her children too."Mary Ann does appear to have behaved well during the years of her sentence," says TC Creaney."She had two successful marriages both to hard working businessmen, and she had no children of her own but adopted two orphans. She showed the determination to put her old ways behind her and aspired to a comfortable and respectable life."Ruth also behaved well during her sentence. She married a farmer but, sadly, didn't live long enough to see the fruits of her labour as she died aged 41."On one extreme, we have Elizabeth, a troubled soul who did not know how to change, then Lydia who was only slightly better," says TC Creaney."Ruth tried to improve her lot but did not live long enough to reap the rewards. Finally, Mary Ann, kept out of trouble, took the opportunities and was undoubtedly the success story of this 'gang of four'."In conclusion, they probably had a better life than they could have expected in England, in that, however bad their new lives were, they had escaped from an even worse fate."
