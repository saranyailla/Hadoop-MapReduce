The couple flew out on January 23 and stayed at The Lagoons, a gated community in Montego Bay where a two-bedroom villa can cost up to $15,000 a week.Bickelmann met Lee through exclusive dating app The League in fall 2018 and the couple went on two trips together to South Carolina in December and Jamaica in January 2019On the Jamaica trip, Lee 'violently struck [her] on the right side of her face with the back of his right hand,' according to court documents seen by DailyMail.com. Lee is pictured second from the left at the New York Society of Security Analysts (NYSSA) conference in 2016As before, Lee paid for everything and, as before, things quickly descended into acrimony.On January 25, two days after their arrival, Bicklemann claims, that Lee committed the first of two assaults against her after they got into an argument in a taxicab.Bickelmann, who works as a buyer for fashion store Milly, is suing for damages to recover from 'personal injuries, emotional distress, assault and battery'According to her lawsuit, 'Lee grabbed [her] face with his hand, shoved her backwards away from him into the seat of the taxi cab and called [her] 'a f***ing b****.'Shocked, Bickelmann called a male friend who advised her that Lee's behavior was 'abnormal and that she should leave Jamaica as soon as she could for her own safety.'She told Lee that she wanted to return to New York and he agreed to change her departure flight from January 27 to 26 while he stayed on.Her court filing states that Lee had planned a yacht outing at 1pm on the day of her departure and therefore told her to leave the villa and head to the airport at 12.30pm.When she said she did not want to make the short trip - some fifteen minutes drive - so early as her flight was not until 3.30pm the couple got into an argument over the best way to lock up the villa.Lee didn't want to be late but nor did he want to leave the keys with Bickelmann.According to Bickelmann the verbal argument turned violent when she attempted to leave the patio where they had been arguing and go back inside.She claimed, 'In the midst of removing herself from this argument with [Lee] who was continuously yelling at her in a degrading manner and cursing at her, [Lee] violently struck [her] on the right side of her face with the back of his right hand.'The hit was so unexpected and violent, she claims, she lost her balance and fell onto a nearby patio chair.Bickelmann says in the lawsuit that Lee knew she had previously been in an abusive relationship and suffered from TMJ which was made worse by his alleged abuseAfter regaining her balance, her complaint continued, 'she ran to another chair…now in fear of being hit a second time… she began to cry and was in disbelief he struck her.'Bickelmann claimed her face 'began to swell and become very red,' and that she repeatedly stated, 'Ram you just hit me!'Her screams and their shouting were loud enough for a concerned neighbor to call The Lagoons Security who witnessed Lee pull the weeping Bickelmann back into the villa and shut the sliding glass doors.The alleged assault was made all the worse, Bickelmann has claimed, by the fact that Lee knew her to be a victim of domestic violence and that she suffered from Temporomandibular Joint Disorder causing her severe pain in her jaw.She has also been diagnosed as suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder as a result of the alleged assault.DailyMail.com has requested comment from both Lee and Bicklemann's attorney, but have not heard back. Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group
