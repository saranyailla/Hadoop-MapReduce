The French league said the alleged perpetrator was subsequently identified and arrested.FIFA says it fully supports Gouano, as well as players such as Kalidou Koulibaly, Raheem Sterling and Danny Rose, who were also subjected to racist abuse.Tottenham defender Rose went so far as to say he was looking forward to retiring from the game in the future because of ongoing racism and a lack of action from authorities.Rose was among England players targeted with monkey chants in Montenegro last month while playing in a European Championship qualifier.Infantino said “it has been very sad to see a number of racist incidents in football. This is really not acceptable.”See new home builder inventory in Las VegasExplore life stories, offer condolences & send flowers.Buy, Sell or just browse to see what's for saleYour best source of local jobs and career trainingRead the latest auto and dealer newsCopyright © 2019 Las Vegas Review-Journal, Inc. | Privacy PolicyPowered by WordPress.com VIP
