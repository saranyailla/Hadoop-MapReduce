WESTBOROUGH - Police say two Worcester men were arrested Thursday on suspicion of breaking into two cars, then fleeing in a stolen car into Grafton in an effort to evade police.At about 3 a.m. Thursday, police received a call from a resident on Arch Street reporting that he had just watched youths attempting to break into the cars parked in his driveway, viewing the activity remotely through his surveillance system while he was at work.Shortly after arriving, an officer noticed two cars in the driveway with open doors and no one around. A second officer noticed a gray Volvo sedan approaching from the opposite direction on Glen Street at a high rate of speed - in the immediate area of the reported suspicious activity.The speeding Volvo nearly caused a head-on collision with the officer’s fully marked cruiser, according to police, so the officer reversed direction and drove west on Rte. 30, identified as Nourse Street in Westborough and Westboro Road in Grafton.The officer lost sight of the Volvo as it drove over a crest of a hill near the Tufts University campus in Grafton. But when the officer arrived in the area where he lost sight of the Volvo, he saw the car parked on the campus lawn with the passenger’s side door open and no occupants inside.A query of the vehicle’s registration revealed the car had been reported stolen from Worcester on Tuesday, said police.A multi-agency search was then initiated to locate and identify the occupants of the Volvo, receiving help from the Town of Grafton and utilizing resources from Westborough, Grafton, Millbury and Oxford police; Tufts University police, the Department of Corrections and Central Massachusetts Law Enforcement Council.Devon Smith, 21, of 80 Arlington St., is charged with using a motor vehicle without authority, larceny under $1,200 by single scheme, negligent operation of a motor vehicle, receiving stolen property, breaking and entering in the nighttime motor vehicle with intent to commit a misdemeanor, speeding, leaving accident scene after property damage, failure to stop for a police officer and operating a motor vehicle with a suspended driver’s license.Edward Gale, 19, of 43 Derby St. in Worcester, was charged with using a motor vehicle without authority, larceny under $1,200 by single scheme, receiving stolen property and breaking and entering in the nighttime motor vehicle with intent to commit a misdemeanor.A third suspect involved in the incident remains at large, said police. © Copyright 2006-2019 GateHouse Media, LLC.
