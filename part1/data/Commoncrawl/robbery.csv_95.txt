Thieves are using hi-tech gadgets to open cars tooDubliners are being warned about a new type of crafty theft which will leave locking your car impossible.Thieves in Killiney Hill car park have reportedly been blocking the signal of driver's keys to their cars meaning that when they press the lock button, it doesn't transfer to the vehicle.There has been several cases of car theft there in recent days and one member of the public has said that it has visitors to the place and locals on edge.He said: I locked my car 3 times but the signal of my key to my car was blocked (2011 car) by the thieves."They can do that when they are nearby. I just came back from the Garda and this is how they operate (I thought this was only possible with the newer keyless fobs/cards).Gardai said that they are "aware of the rising thefts in Killiney Hill car park and they are patrolling the area every day".They advised the installment of CCTV cameras but that is a decision for the council.This comes after an angry Dubliner warned people to be vigilant about what they leave visible in their car after valuable sporting goods and children's presidents were taken in a break-in.The windows of Sean De Faoite's car were smashed in while parked at South Beach in Rush on Wednesday night.Taken from the vehicle were his child's boxing gear as well as Easter eggs which were recently bought for the youngster.Sean went for a run up the beach with his dogs and was gone for about 30 minutes but he returned at around 8:30pm to find a sickening scene.Sean said: "When I pulled into the car park, there was a group of kids on bikes hanging around. He added: "When I got back, the kids were gone and my window was smashed and son's boxing gear was gone."The gear is worth about €200 but it has no resale value - second hand gloves, shoes and mits."No one else was ever going to buy them."Sean went on to say that he thinks the children that took the goods were doing it "for a buzz rather than any real criminal or financial benefit."He said: "There was kids going around slashing tyres in Lusk village a few months back and that was 'just for kicks' too."Luckily for Sean, a jogger came to the rescue and handed the belongings into Rush Boxing Club.He added: "All the gear is still in there too. It was founded by a jogger on the beach."I rang him to say a massive thanks and Paul, the head coach of the boxing club, met him and got the bag off him and thanked him for me also."You can like our main Facebook page here.Our Dublin Live Sports Page - which brings you all your Dublin sports news - can be found here.The Dublin Live Twitter account is @DublinLive.Our Instagram account can be found here.
