Ontario Conservative Premier Doug Ford unveiled their $28.5-billion transit expansion in Etobicoke on Wednesday April 10, 2019. Jack Boland/Toronto Sun/ Premier Doug Ford made an astounding commitment to improve public transit across Toronto and the GTA in last week’s Ontario budget, with one key qualification.That is that an astounding plan is still just a plan.It does nothing to make the lives of public transit commuters better, nor improve traffic congestion now costing our economy billions of dollars every year, until it’s built.And we’ve heard such promises made before.Defeated Liberal premier Kathleen Wynne made a similar commitment in 2014 to a massive investment in Ontario public transit and transportation infrastructure, which died with her government’s defeat in June.Now Ford is making a major budgetary commitment to what he says will be the $28.5 billion cost of constructing four new Toronto/GTA subways, noting the province has financial tools to get it done that are not available to municipal governments.Ford says the province will put up $11.2 billion, with expected buy-ins from the federal, Toronto and York regional governments to make up the rest, but Ontario is prepared to go it alone if necessary.The challenge is Ford’s plan has so many moving parts it could all easily come apart, or face interminable delays and cost overruns because of inter-government bickering, as has so often happened in the past.The key component of Ford’s subway plan is the newly-named Ontario Line, replacing the city’s desperately needed downtown relief line, to alleviate severe station overcrowding at rush hours in the city’s core.Ford’s Ontario Line would be twice as long as the one planned by the city and, the Premier says, can be completed by 2027 instead of 2029 using new, albeit more expensive technology.Shortly after that, the Yonge St. subway (Line 1) would be extended north to the Richmond Hill Centre.Scarborough would get its long-awaited, three-stop subway extension (the city’s current plan is one stop) by 2030, three years longer than under the existing plan, while the western extension of the Eglinton Crosstown LRT would be built, underground, to Pearson Airport, completed before 2031.The sticking point is Ford wants the province to upload ownership of the city’s subways to the province, leaving the TTC to operate the system, to which many city councillors are opposed.While Mayor John Tory says he’s enthusiastic about Ford committing major provincial dollars to Toronto subway expansion, he’s already disappointed that in last week’s budget Ford broke an election commitment to increase city revenues from a provincial gas tax hike by $1.1 billion over the next decade, money that was to be used to keep the city’s public transit system in good repair.Both sides need to remember commuters don’t care who builds or operates subways.After decades of delays and false starts, they just want them built and the system properly maintained.We encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts.
