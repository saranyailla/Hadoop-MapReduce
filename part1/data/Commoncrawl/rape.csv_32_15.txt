LOUDONVILLE — A community-wide meeting will be held Tuesday, April 16 at 6 p.m. in the Loudonville High School cafeteria to discuss a long-range plan that has been developed for the Loudonville-Perrysville Schools. School administrators and staff have been working on the plan since last fall. Plan central in the district is room 211 in the Budd Elementary School, formerly the school principal’s office, where the walls of the room are draped with huge pieces of paper with lists of plan objectives written on them. The plan will involve eight phases of school operations: academics, athletics, community engagement, technology, facilities, food service, school safety, staff development and transportation. The plan has been prepared by Superintendent Catherine Puster and her administrative team, with input from teachers and staff. "After the community meeting, the administration will again prioritize the plan, with the hope of first receiving input on it from community members, and then receiving board approval for it by the end of the school year," Puster said. Puster said all people interested in the future of the Loudonville-Perrysville Schools are encouraged to attend and participate in next Tuesday’s meeting.
