These generous civic leaders helped feed supporters of the women’s auxiliary of the Madera Rescue Mission. Held at the First Christian Church, 2300 Sunset Avenue the annual Soup and Dessert Luncheon and bake sale benefitted the mission. On the menu were a wide variety of soups and stews. “We have Ron Snipe and his split pea soup, Burrito King furnished meatball (albondigas) soup, we have minestrone from DiCicco’s Italian and Farnesi’s restaurants, both chicken noodle and clam chowder from Kay McCullough, and I made tortilla and bean with bacon soups,” said Betty Smith “We also have pasta Faggioli from Sherry DeFina and vegetable soup from Country Waffle.” A contingent of members comprised of Carol Vigil president, vice president Defina and auxiliary president emeritus Betty Smith organized the donations, decorated the church’s social hall and spent months selling tickets to the event. “We are happy to be a part of this event,” said Pastor Michael G. Stipe, known as Pastor Mike. The diners enjoyed the lively and spiritual music played by a four-man combo comprised of Ignacio Ruiz, Chuck DeFina, Dexter Young and Ted Beck. The band goes by the name Joyful Noise. The Madera Rescue offers men and women, those with substance abuse problems, the homeless and the hungry with shelter and food for both the body and the soul. The Madera Rescue Mission is at 332 Elm Street.
