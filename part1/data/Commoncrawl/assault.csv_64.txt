Five years later, while the BJP is working overtime to dislodge Maharashtra Congress chief Ashok Chavan from Nanded, the other winning Congress MP from 2014, Rajeev Satav from Hingoli, is not in the fray this time.Chavan has led the Congress to other victories after 2014 — three Assembly seats in Nanded in November 2014, then a huge win in the Nanded-Waghela Municipal Corporation in 2017, where the party grew from 41 corporators to 73 corporators out of 81.

A rebellion against him by a Sena MLA was quelled earlier, but Danve reportedly faced some embarrassment recently when crowds gathered to hear him speak suddenly began to disperse — municipal water supply in Jalna, restricted to once in 7-8 days, had just begun and some people reportedly hurried home to fill up storage tanks. Water supply, jobs and farm distress are the issues here. Danve once again faces Congress’s Vilas Autade, whom he defeated by over 2 lakh votes in 2014.Read | Beyond Marathwada’s agrarian crisis, BJP’s nationalism campaign finds resonance with farmersIn Parbhani, two-term Sena MP Sanjay ‘Bandu’ Jadhav faces serious anti-incumbency while the NCP has fielded former zila parishad president Rajesh Vitekar, a 39-year-old whose campaign is almost entirely focused on rural distress and the need for agro-business and agro-industries in the district. Parbhani, with a sizeable Muslim population, is also heavily polarised, with opponents accusing the Sena of communalising every election here, turning it into a bhagwa vs hirwa (saffron versus green) battle. Parbhani has had a Sena MP since 1989 with the exception of the 1998 election.Latur, once a Congress bastion from where former Union home minister Shivraj Patil was elected for seven consecutive terms from 1980 onwards, is witnessing a pitched battle between the BJP and Congress, led by two political dynasties — the Nilangekars and the Deshmukhs. While state minister Sambhaji Patil Nilangekar, the district’s guardian minister and BJP leader, has backed zila parishad leader Sudhakar Shrungare, Congress MLA Amit Deshmukh, son of former CM Vilasrao Deshmukh, is leading the Congress campaign for Machhindra Kamat, who was preparing to contest the Assembly election from Udgir.Also Read | BJP importing candidates from other parties: Ashok ChavanThe Sena will look to retain Aurangabad where veteran MP Chandrakant Khaire is seeking a fifth term.

Her chief opponent is Bajrang Sonawane of the NCP, whose campaign is being led by her cousin Dhananjay Munde, leader of the Opposition in the Maharashtra Legislative Council.In Hingoli, where the Congress has given a ticket to former Shiv Sena MP Subhash Wankhede, who contested on a Sena ticket in 2014 and lost by a whisker, there is some anger among Congress voters regarding sitting MP Rajeev Satav’s disinclination to contest.Download the Indian Express apps for iPhone, iPad or Android© 2019 The Indian Express Ltd.
