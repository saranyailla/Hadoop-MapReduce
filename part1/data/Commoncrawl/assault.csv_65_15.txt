During a trial in a Barrie courtroom last week, the Crown said he had sole care of the baby for about two days from the evening of Dec. 25-27, 2016. Court heard the mother became upset and left the night of Dec. 25, and the man was left to care for their baby girl without her. When he brought the baby to the mother’s apartment on Dec. 27, she noticed the infant was twitching and in distress. The baby was rushed to the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, where it was determined she was having seizures and had bleeding in the brain, eyes and spinal cord and injuries to her neck ligaments. A specialist testified the baby had been violently shaken. The girl is now blind and suffers from traumatic brain injury. The Crown noted this was not a crime of malice, but rather the case of an overwhelmed individual. The defence argued the mother was “not happy” with being a new mother and could have been the one who harmed her baby.A judge is expected to announce his verdict later this month.
