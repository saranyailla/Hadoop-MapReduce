NEW BRUNSWICK  — A former Rutgers University football player who allegedly plotted to murder his ex-girlfriend's parents in an attempt to win her back will be freed from jail pending his trial.A judge granted Izaia Bullock's release Wednesday over the objections of Middlesex County prosecutors. He will be under home detention and will be electronically monitored.The 22-year-old Bullock is charged with two counts each of attempted murder and conspiracy, as well as a single count of cyber harassment. Prosecutors had argued that Bullock needed to remain jailed to protect witnesses and ensure he returns to court.Bullock was arrested on Oct. 29 after authorities said he confirmed to Rutgers police his plan to commit the double murder and a search of his vehicle uncovered a mask, gloves and crushed Tylenol.(Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.
