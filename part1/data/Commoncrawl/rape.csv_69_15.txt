At the Fall 2019 collections this past Fashion Month, one outerwear silhouette stood out in the sea of great coats: the cape. There were several stylish variations on the sleeveless style, ranging from Celine’s draped camel shapes to Chanel’s structured tweed takes. The evening cape is a relatively new proposition in particular, one that Brie Larson just put to the test on the red carpet.Today, the actress appeared at the South Korea premiere of her new film, Avengers: Endgame, donning a sleek leather cape. Hers was by Valentino and featured a leather tie that was slung around her neck. Larson, who stars as Captain Marvel in the new movie, wore her cape with a printed shift dress, black tights, and some cool moto boots. Her look proved that the trend, usually styled in a more casual context, can be done in a more dressed-up setting. But more than that, it showed that superheroine style is alive and kicking.The latest fashion news, beauty coverage, celebrity style, fashion week updates, culture reviews, and videos on Vogue.com.More from VogueSee More Stories© 2019 Condé Nast.
