An anti-abortion film which major Hollywood studios refused to fund was screened at the White House on Friday night, amid jubilation from conservatives who believe the film industry will now wake up to their perspective.“Conservatives had given up on Hollywood,” said Phelim McAleer, the Irish producer of the film.“People told us they hadn’t gone to the cinema since The Sound of Music. Hollywood was insulting them. They were tired of having their beliefs ridiculed. The success of the film is absolutely part of a growing trend.”The White House screening came the day after Ohio’s governor signed a law banning abortion at six weeks – the fifth state to do so, and the third this year.All have been blocked by the courts, but pro-choice activists agree that anti-abortion activists are riding a wave of presidential support.At the White House for screening of Gosnell movie pic.twitter.com/h8mHrIMvrq“With Trump in the White House and Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court, it is clear politicians are more emboldened than ever,” said Dr Leana Wen, president of Planned Parenthood.She told The Telegraph that access to abortion care is disappearing - in six states people have only one abortion provider left.  “They are spreading misinformation and lies in order to further an ideological agenda - at the cost of real people and families,” she said.Planned Parenthood spokesperson Andrew Taverrite added the White House's screening of the film was in line with their own political agenda, but he argued it was not in line with what healthcare actually is. McAleer’s film, Gosnell, tells the true story of a Philadelphia doctor, Kermit Gosnell, who ran an abortion clinic. He was convicted in May 2013 of first degree murder, after three of the infants were born alive during the botched procedure. He was also found guilty of involuntary manslaughter following the death of one woman during the treatment, and convicted of carrying out illegal late-term abortion and violating informed consent laws.Gosnell, now 78, is serving life in prison.“I was making a fracking documentary in Pennsylvania at the time, and came across the Gosnell trial in a local newspaper,” McAleer, a former investigative journalist turned documentary maker, told The Telegraph.#GosnellMovie’s @annmcelhinney & @PhelimMcAleer are on the way to Washington, DC for the @WhiteHouse screening of the film tomorrow! pic.twitter.com/fIeWIffkmH“There were incredible pictures, it was absolutely horrific – the most shocking evidence I had ever seen. But what was more surprising was that it was getting very little coverage.”Along with his wife, Ann McElhinney, McAleer wrote a book about the case, which forms the basis of the film.But producing the film, with its strong anti-abortion message, was a tough task in liberal-dominated Hollywood.The couple turned to crowdfunding, raising $2.3 million (£1.75m) from 30,000 people over 45 days in what was, at the time, the largest haul in history.Casting the film was no easier.“An actor would agree, say, on a Wednesday,” recalled McAleer. “Then, over the weekend, they’d talk to their friends and family. And on Sunday we’d get a text message saying: ‘You know, I’ve just realised I’ve got a holiday booked so can’t do the film.’ It happened multiple times.”In the end Dean Cain, star of Superman, accepted the role – McAleer said it was that “he just loved the truth”.Cain defended the film on Twitter, writing: “There is nothing ‘gory; in the film Gosnell.  That’s a flat-out lie.  Raw emotion makes this film tough to watch, not gore.”The film was screened in 650 theatres and took over $4 million.The success of Gosnell was followed by another anti-abortion film, Unplanned, based on the memoir of a former director at Planned Parenthood, who became an anti-abortion activist.The film, released on March 29, exceeded box-office expectations on its opening weekend, earning more than $6 million and recouping its budget from just 1,100 screens.Church groups and pro-life activists organised outings to the cinema to see the film, which was backed by conservative politicians including Mike Pence, the vice president, Senator Ted Cruz and Donald Trump Jr.Distributors expanded the number of cinemas showing the film last weekend, earning $3.2 million after spreading to 500 more theatres.Champions of the film point out that its success has been despite what they see as a liberal media campaign to dampen the film.Companies holding the rights to the songs they had hoped to use turned them down, and television networks refused to screen the trailer. The star of the film, Ashley Bratcher, who plays Abby Johnson, has struggled to book TV interviews outside Fox News and the Christian Broadcasting Network, and Fox News reported that Google classifies Unplanned as a “drama/propaganda”.But pro-life activists certainly feel that the momentum is with them.The Ohio governor’s signing of the “heartbeat bill” on Thursday followed in the footsteps of the governors of Mississippi and Kentucky this year. Georgia, South Carolina and Missouri are expected to swiftly follow suit, and Alabama is aiming to bring in the strictest legislation ever by banning abortion after two weeks – before most women realise they are pregnant.At the moment, under Roe v Wade – which pro-choice activists want to overturn – abortion is allowed by law in all states until 22-24 weeks, after which period life is deemed viable.The Ohio decision was immediately challenged in the courts – as were similar laws in North Dakota in 2013 and Iowa last year. All have so far been deemed unconstitutional.Activists are hoping that the fight will go all the way to the Supreme Court, and that Roe v Wade will ultimately be overturned.Planned Parenthood say that “the one positive” is that a record number of states are moving forward with proactive legislation.New York has introduced a reproductive health act, and Vermont is aiming to become the first ever state to guarantee abortion rights at a state level.The organisation has also seen a surge of support during the Trump administration, with 12 million supporters now registered.“We have to fight back, and aggressively push for policies that protect and expand reproductive health access,” said Dr Wen.“Legalising abortion did not create the need for it.“Politicians who wish to reduce unintended pregnancies and the need for abortion should invest in women’s health.”© Telegraph Media Group Limited 2019We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Need help?Visit our adblocking instructions
