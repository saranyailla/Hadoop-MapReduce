	A 39-year-old London man with an apparent sweet tooth has been charged with robbery and resisting arrest.
	A store clerk at a mini-mart on Dundas Street was allegedly threatened with a knife on Sunday night after a man took two tubs of mint chocolate chip ice cream and left the store.
	London police say when the suspect was confronted, he produced a large knife and fled the area.
	The suspect was located a short distance away from the store.
	The dessert was a costly treat as he was charged with robbery and resisting arrest.
	He was scheduled to appear in a London court on Monday.
