A year after Yarmouth police Sgt. Sean Gannon was fatally shot while trying to serve an arrest warrant on a career criminal, multiple bills have been introduced to change the rules around bail and pretrial detention, as well as to study the bail-setting process, but none have been scheduled for an initial hearing, much less a vote.In all, five bills have been introduced this legislative session, including a measure refiled by Gov. Charlie Baker after a previous version never made it to a vote.Baker’s bill would change the way bail is set, handled and appealed in the courts, as well as remove a cap on the length of time a defendant may be held as a danger to the community. When he refiled the bill, he cited Gannon’s killing as part of the impetus, as well as the death of Kevin Quinn, 32, of Mashpee, in a car crash caused by Mickey Rivera, a Fall River man out on bail despite multiple open cases.Baker’s bill was referred to the Joint Committee on the Judiciary, made up of House and Senate members. The other four bills that propose changes to bail or related issues also have been sent to the Joint Committee.The committee has met once since the start of the new year, on April 2, to discuss a series of bills proposing constitutional amendments. No additional hearing dates have been set.Baker said Rivera was an example where the total criminal record should have been looked at when bail was being set. Rivera had been released on his own recognizance in a Barnstable drunken-driving case a month before the fatal July crash while he was also awaiting trial on charges related to a 2015 killing in Fall River. He had been released in 2017 in that case after his bail was reduced.Baker’s bill would increase the number of offenses that prosecutors may use to request a dangerousness hearing and would allow for defendants to be held without bail until trial, instead of the current standard of 120 days set in district court or 180 days in Superior Court.It also would add a history of violent criminal convictions to the list of reasons a prosecutor could offer to request a defendant be held as a danger.Gannon, 32, was shot and killed April 12, 2018, while helping a team of officers serve an arrest warrant at a house in Marstons Mills. Thomas Latanowich, 30, who is charged with first-degree murder in Gannon’s death, has a 16-year criminal history, including dozens of charges related to drugs, guns and violence.According to a review by the Times in June, the reason Latanowich was free in the community, despite having been charged in 75 prior cases, some of which included as many as 26 counts, was complicated.Baker’s bill would allow prosecutors to use past convictions for violent crimes as the basis to file a petition to have a defendant held without bail pending trial.“Current law requires courts to focus on only the crime charged and ignore a defendant’s criminal history when determining whether the defendant may be the subject of this sort of hearing,” Baker wrote in a preamble to the bill.Rep. Timothy Whelan, R-Brewster, said the only legislative movement so far has been approval of a bill to fund police training, but the Cape and Islands delegation has met with the leadership of the Trial Court.He also referred to Baker’s bill but said he did not know when it would come up for a committee hearing.“I don’t think the good Lord himself could give a specific timeline on it,” Whelan said.He said he hopes it gets a hearing as quickly as possible.The delegation also sent a letter to leaders of the Joint Committee, asking them to convene an oversight hearing to investigate what happened with Latanowich’s past cases.No hearing was ever set.State Sen. Julian Cyr, D-Truro, said he and the rest of the delegation have asked the Joint Committee for the oversight hearing “time and time again.”Cyr said he thinks Baker’s bill will be heard sooner rather than later, and he hopes to elicit testimony that would otherwise come up during an oversight hearing.Baker’s bill would establish a task force to make recommendations, and possibly draft legislation, to increase the amount of information judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, bail commissioners and probation officers have when making decisions on bail.Specifically, the task force would consider the “value, cost and practicality” of adding more information to criminal history reports, including prior findings of dangerousness, conditions of release set in other cases and the reasons listed for detention.“In general principle, it’s good that whoever is making the decision to hold and not to release a defendant has a fair amount of information in order to make the best decision,” Boston defense attorney Peter Elikann said.Cape and Islands District Attorney Michael O’Keefe said prosecutors and judges must be vigilant when assessing criminal defendants and thoroughly examine criminal histories.“If each party does that, at least there will be an informed decision made for the release or detention of the person,” O’Keefe said.The judge has the authority to seek out records and information and is the ultimate authority in setting bail.“It really comes down to common sense, both for the judges and prosecutors,” O’Keefe said.Superior Court Judge Robert Ullmann said he looks at criminal history reports and relies on the defense and prosecution to give him the context of what is reflected in the reports.For example, charges dismissed because witnesses were intimidated would be viewed differently than a dismissal because charges were unwarranted.“It’s up to the commonwealth to provide that information,” Ullmann said. “With bail decisions, there’s typically a limited amount of time.”He said more electronic access to records, such as documents that list why certain decisions were made, would be helpful, but judges would have to be careful with how much they relied on that.“In the absence of a reason for a dismissal, I would not assume anything,” Ullmann said.
