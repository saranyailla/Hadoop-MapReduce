That warning came after a teenage boy was threatened with two kitchen knives during a robbery at a tram station in Bury.All three attacks come after the M.E.N. revealed how knife crime is having a devastating effect on communities across the region.There were 787 knife crimes in Greater Manchester in the first three months of 2019, according to Greater Manchester Police.Of those, 388 were knifepoint robberies and 26 were rape in which a blade was used.Earlier this week campaigners warned that knife crime is having a bigger impact than gun crime two decades previously.While a senior cop from Greater Manchester Police - whose officers are battling at least 10 knife crimes a day - has warned that knife crime is no longer ‘a London thing’.Assistant Chief Constable Rob Potts has spoken of a noticeable increase in personal robberies involving knives and young people carrying blades in the mistaken belief that it will offer them protection."I think they genuinely believe, but we know statistically they are much more likely to be a victim of harm if they carry a knife, than not," he said last month.Police have ramped up patrols across areas of Bolton, Trafford and Bury after the three Friday night attacks.Officers are appealing for witnesses to all three incidents while detectives question the seven people arrested on suspicion of a range of offences.The first incident happened at around 7.40pm on Friday night at Whitefield Metrolink station.A teenage boy was threatened at knifepoint and robbed of his belongings by ‘a group of youths’ at the station, off Stanley Road.A girl, aged 14, and two boys, aged 15 and 17, have been arrested on suspicion of robbery.The girl has also been arrested on suspicion of possessing a bladed article, as well as two counts of police assault.The older boy was also arrested for possession of drugs with intent to supply.Anyone with information about this incident should contact police quoting incident number 2089 of 12/04/19.Less than an hour later, police were called to The Melville Hotel, in Stretford, following reports of a disturbance.When officers arrived at the pub, on Melville Road, at around 8.30pm they found a man with serious injuries who was rushed to hospital and remains there in a critical condition.Three men, aged 52, 39 and 30, have been arrested on suspicion of section 18 assault.
