We had six goals in a game last night in a period. There were days in the playoffs where you wouldn’t get six goals in a game not too long ago, but I think those days are gone.”Big match-up:Nathan MacKinnon vs. Mikael BacklundIn Game 1, Backlund was all over the Avs superstar centre. He limited the damage MacKinnon could do and scored a third-period goal, too. MacKinnon had a few good opportunities, to be sure, but Flames goaltender Mike Smith stood tall when he had to. Backlund and his pals on the 3M Line put up three goals on Thursday, and if they can keep the Avs pinned back in their own zone again, the Flames are in good shape.

Who’s hot?Matthew Tkachuk — The Flames winger always seemed like the type of guy who would thrive in the playoffs, and he lived up to that hype in Game 1 with a highly physical game from start-to-finish on Thursday night. Oh, and he also added two goals, so Tkachuk was everything anyone could have hoped for.Flames lineup notes:The Flames are rolling with the exact same lines and defensive pairings that they went with on Thursday night in Game 1. They won that one 4-0, so it’s not exactly surprising that they’re sticking with what worked. Mike Smith will start the night in net, a no-brainer after his 26-save goose-egg.Flames lineup:FORWARDS:Johnny Gaudreau-Sean Monahan-Elias LindholmMatthew Tkachuk-Mikael Backlund-Michael FrolikSam Bennett-Mark Jankowski-James NealAndrew Mangiapane-Derek Ryan-Garnet HathawayDEFENCE:Mark Giordano-TJ BrodieNoah Hanifin-Travis HamonicOscar Fantenberg-Rasmus AnderssonGOALIES:Mike SmithDavid RittichAvalanche notes:The big question was whether the Avalanche would reunite the top line of MacKinnon, captain Gabriel Landeskog and Mikko Rantanen, but head coach Jared Bednar isn’t planning to start the evening that way.
