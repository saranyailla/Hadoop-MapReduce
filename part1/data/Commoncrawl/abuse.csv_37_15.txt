Published: April 15, 2019 Updated: April 15, 2019 4:36 PM EDT Filed Under:Mark Stone, Matt Duchene and Robin Lehner are long gone from Ottawa, but certainly not forgotten.Not quite midway through the opening round of the NHL playoffs, the spotlight is shining brightly on the former Senators stars.While it’s now all about tomorrow and a rebuild for the Senators organization, it’s hard not to notice what the three ex-Senators have done over the past week. For Senators fans, their success is a bit like pouring salt into the wound of painful trades.

–Lehner, once upon a time deemed the Senators goaltender of the future, has backstopped his New York Islanders to a commanding 3-0 series lead over the Pittsburgh Penguins.–Duchene, who originally came to the Senators in the hopes of realizing his wish of an extended playoff run, has become the offensive leader for a Columbus Blue Jackets team on the verge of knocking out the Tampa Bay Lightning in what could go down as one of the most colossal upsets in NHL history.–Stone, meanwhile, went into Monday’s action atop the NHL playoff scoring race, fresh from the first hat trick of his career – that’s right, he never scored one during his stellar career in Ottawa – in giving his Vegas Golden Knights a 2-1 series lead over the San Jose Sharks.

The Golden Knights defeated the Sharks 6-3 to take a 2-1 lead in the series.

In the big picture of the sporting world, of course, it was Tiger’s weekend; a remarkable comeback to the top of the golfing world.Yet just as the Woods celebration was calming down late in the afternoon, Lehner was being heralded for yet another stellar performance in the Islanders net, stopping 25 of 26 shots. Lehner owns a 1.62 goals against average, with a .951 save percentage.For those who forget the history, Lehner lost his spot in the Senators organizational depth chart in 2015, sitting out with a concussion during the remarkable Hamburglar run.He was then traded to the Buffalo Sabres, along with David Legwand and his contract, for the first-round draft pick that eventually became current centre Colin White.

Signed as a free agent by the Islanders last summer, Lehner’s personal recovery from addiction to booze and pills, a bipolar disorder and suicidal thoughts, had made him the leading candidate to win the Bill Masterton Trophy.Now, he’s pouring playoff gravy on all of that. Before the current post-season run, Lehner had only 49 minutes of NHL playoff experience, mop-up duty in a series against the Penguins while with the Senators in 2013.If the Islanders 3-0 edge on the Penguins can be considered a major surprise, the Duchene-led Blue Jackets advantage on the Lightning is akin to David taking down Goliath.

Only 1:44 into Sunday’s game, Duchene scored to set off the infamous Columbus cannon, setting the tone for what became a 3-1 victory and the commanding 3-0 series lead. Duchene leads the Blue Jackets in playoff scoring, with two goals and three assists.Playoff success is what Duchene hoped for when the Senators made the colossal deal to acquire him in 2017.As difficult as it is for Senators fans to watch, there is a potential silver lining. Should an extended Blue Jackets playoff run – they’ve yet to win a single post-season series since joining the NHL in 2000 – lead to Duchene signing a long-term contract extension, the Senators will receive an additional first round draft pick in 2020. In the original trade deadline deal, the Senators also received the Blue Jackets 2019 first-round pick, along with prospects Vitaly Abramov and Jonathan Davidson.

As Duchene and company were basking in the Sunday victory, Stone was just getting started in Vegas.A mere 16 seconds into Game 3, Stone opened the scoring with a breakaway backhand goal over the shoulder of Sharks goaltender Martin Jones.He finished off the Sharks with a pair of third period goals, along with a pair of second period assists, to complete a five-point night. For those not still awake as Sunday turned to Monday, the wild Stone jubilation would have seemed familiar to Senators fans who have seen his emotional outbursts in the past.

The Golden Knights defeated the Sharks 6-3 to take a 2-1 lead in the series.

The return for Stone included star 19-year-old defenceman Erik Brannstrom, who could join the Senators as early as next season. The Senators also received a 2020 second-round draft pick and centre Oscar Lindberg, who had a strong finish to the regular season in Ottawa, but likely isn’t going to re-sign here in the summer.That’s the future the Senators have to bank on from losing Stone.For now, though, Stone has six goals and two assists in three games, his name and photo front and centre where NHL.com lists its statistical leaders. The line of Stone, Max Pacioretty and Paul Stastny, who all came from elsewhere this season, has combined for 10 goals and 12 assists in a mere three games.

If it’s any consolation to Senators fans, it’s that all three of Stone’s goals came with former Senators captain Erik Karlsson on the ice, unable to contain him and the rest of the Golden Knights.Karlsson has five points in three games and is tied with Winnipeg’s Dustin Byfuglien for the playoff scoring lead among defencemen, but Karlsson and the Sharks have struggled defensively.Seemingly, everywhere you look in the NHL playoffs, there’s a Senators connection somewhere.kwarren@postmedia.comTwitter: @Citizenwarren ALSO IN THE NEWSAfter 48 years and over 1,000 games, a rec-league hockey player joins the 500 clubVideo: Notre-Dame Cathedral on fireBack to the future as Redblacks hire Joe PaopaoWe encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts.
