The former press secretary for former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign is backing a movement to fire Brett Kavanaugh from teaching at George Mason University.Former Clinton press secretary Brian Fallon is the executive director of the liberal advocacy group Demand Justice, according to Fox News. After the George Mason undergraduate group “Mason For Survivors” started a petition to remove Kavanaugh, Fallon began using Facebook ads to target anyone with ties to George Mason.The ads pushed viewers to both sign a petition to remove Kavanaugh as well as to sign a petition to push members of Congress to investigate Kavanaugh, according to HuffPost.

We stand with survivors and urge the George Mason University administration to fire Kavanaugh.”The petition, which has garnered almost 5,000 signatures so far, calls on George Mason University to “Terminate AND void ALL contracts and affiliation with Brett Kavanaugh at George Mason University,” and accuses the George Mason University administration of “a historic amount of institutional negligence on your part to support survivors of sexual assault and the student body as a whole, which has bred a sense of mistrust and suffering within the Mason community and allies.”“I respect the views of people who disagreed with Justice Kavanaugh’s Senate confirmation due to questions raised about his sexual conduct in high school. But he was confirmed and is now a sitting Justice,” George Mason University President Ángel Cabrera said in a March statement. “The law school has determined that the involvement of a U.S. Supreme Court Justice contributes to making our law program uniquely valuable for our students. And I accept their judgment.”Mason 4 Survivors will host a town hall discussion which Cabrera will attend on April 16, according to The Huffington Post.Follow Mary Margaret on Twitter.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
