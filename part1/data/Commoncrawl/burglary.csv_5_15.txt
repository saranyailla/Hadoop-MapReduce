He hopes to purchase the drones before July 4.“They won’t be randomly flow into the sky just to look for things,” he said. “They’ll be only launched in instances where there is a safety or hazard issue.”Examples of use would include flying over a large warehouse where there was a burglary, he said. Or they could be used to take pictures of an accident accident or help with mapping or an emergency operation or a crime scene.Keller said in an interview last week that a policy — still to be written — will be “very strict on privacy.”Planned use of drones by the Los Angeles Police Department and county Sheriff’s Department has drawn opposition in the past.But more and more departments are using them, according to a May 2018 study by researchers at Bard College in New York, home of Center for the Study of the Drone. The study counted 14 law enforcement agencies in Southern California using drones. That group included the Azusa, Pomona and West Covina police departments in the San Gabriel Valley.In the Inland Empire, police in Chino, Upland and San Bernardino all have employed drones, which can cost between a few hundred dollars and several thousand dollars.In January, the Los Angeles Police Department used a drone for the first time during a standoff last week between SWAT officers and a robbery suspect in Koreatown. LAPD Chief Michel Moore said the drone was used to give officers a view inside a second-story apartment where police believed the suspect was hiding.Montebello Councilman Sal Melendez, who had concerns about invading people’s privacy, said Keller’s explanation satisfied him that privacy will be protected in deploying the drones.“I know they are going to be beneficial to our department,” Melendez said. “They will help with out with tactical and emergency operations and traffic collisions.”Before the drones — once they’re purchased — can be put into service, officers must be trained as pilots and a policy must be written, Keller said. About seven officers will need receive the training, so there’s always one on duty, he added.Get the latest news delivered daily!
