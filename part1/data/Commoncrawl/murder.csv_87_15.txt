Blue and purple ribbons have been appearing around Croydon in memory of Kelva Smith and Andre Aderemi“These mums are part of a club that no one wants to join.”  Across London it's a club that tragically keeps on getting bigger. Yemi Hughes and Lisa Smith have experienced what no parent should, having both lost a son to knife crime. The grieving mums, who are both from Croydon, cannot bare the thought of anyone else going through what they have.  So they have joined forces as part of a campaign to demand action to stop the so many young people being stabbed to death. They are working with Nichole Young to hang handmade blue and purple ribbons around Croydon and beyond.“We wanted to raise awareness in Croydon for the two boys who were lost,” said Nichole.“These mums do not want anyone else to have to go through that dark, dark, dark place.“These mums are part of a club that no one wants to join.”Lisa's son Kelva was killed in South Norwood in March 2018. The 20-year-old was stabbed multiple times on Albert Road at about 5pm on Monday, March 5.He died in the arms of his cousin, Levi Sargeant, while tearful members of the public watched on.Tyrone Farquharson was convicted of his murder at a trial in 2018 and the 20-year-old, of Archer Road in South Norwood, was jailed for 21 years.The campaign’s blue ribbons are in tribute to Kelva.Yemi's 19-year-old son Andre lost his life in August 2016 after being stabbed on the Monks Hill Estate, in Selsdon.Ali Zahawy and Rodney Mukasa, both 20, were found guilty of Andre's murder in 2017.Femi Cela, 19, was found guilty of manslaughter but not guilty of murder - despite Judge Zoe Smith describing him as the one who orchestrated the "mob-handed attack".Andre was stabbed, kicked and hit with a metal pole having been chased through the Selsdon estate on August 16. He was stabbed about 20 times and died in hospital later that evening from his injuries.The brutal killing was the horrific culmination of a bitter feud between two rival groups which a jury at the Old Bailey was told had initially been sparked by a row over a girl.The former Oasis Academy Shirley Park pupil was found with wounds to his head, face, back, torso, shoulder, hands and knee.Zahawy, of Bramble Close, Shirley, was sentenced to life in prison for the murder, with a minimum of 22 years to be served. Mukasa, of Greenview Avenue, Shirley, has also been sent to prison for life with a minimum of 22 years.Cela, who was also known as Fabio, of Fryston Avenue, Addiscombe, was handed a 16-year sentence for his role in the death.Three weeks after the trio were sentenced, Jamell Lonergan, 19, who drove them away from the scene, pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was jailed for 10 years after a jury failed to determine whether he was guilty of murder.The campaign’s purple ribbons are in honour of Andre. “The pain and suffering from not only the bereaved parents but the wider community has sparked a togetherness from those impacted to stand up and stop knife crime,” said Nichole.The groups have been posting their campaigning efforts to social media to raise awareness, and have now received orders for their ribbons from across the UK.People in Cheshire, Wales, Eastbourne, Southend, Southampton and Milton Keynes have placed orders for the ribbons, with more coming in every day.“We are just trying to help in any way we can,” added Nichole.“[The ribbons] remind the community that these lives have been taken and that everywhere there is a ribbon placed people in the community are saying no to knives.“These ribbons mean something to these people.”The Croydon resident is also acting on behalf of Operation Shutdown, a country-wide movement against knife crime which will culminate in a peaceful protest at Downing Street on April 17.Shutdown is made up of bereaved parents and seasoned campaigners who are demanding action to tackle the issue head-on.The campaign has set out a long list of 15 demands ahead of the protest, including the government calling an emergency government COBRA meeting and an independent public inquiry into school exclusions and their links to serious violence.We've set up a new WhatsApp group so you can receive the latest London headlines straight to your phone.To receive one message a day with the main headlines, as well as breaking news alerts, send one of the following to 07900 342671 on WhatsApp, depending on where you want to receive news from:Then add the number to your phone contacts book as 'MyLondon'.
