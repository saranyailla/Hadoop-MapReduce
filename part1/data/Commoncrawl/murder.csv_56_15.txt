Rugby / 15 April 2019, 8:20pm / Staff WriterHe is regarded as one of the leading singers in South Africa, but on a big sporting stage, Kurt Darren slipped up.Afrikaans pop star Darren was tasked with singing the national anthem, Nkosi Sikelel’ iAfrika, at Monday night’s Varsity Cup final between Maties and Tuks at the Danie Craven Stadium in Stellenbosch.But after getting going, Darren messed up the second verse of the anthem, which saw the players with puzzled looks on their faces.He got the first line out – “Morena boloka setjhaba sa heso” – but then instead of continuing with “O fedise dintwa la matshwenyeh”, Darren reverted back to the end of the first stanza, singing: “Yizwa imithandazo, yethu”.He completed the rest of the anthem, but he was ridiculed for his error on social media.“And just like that Kurt Darren completely butchers the National Anthem! Check the Tukkies players chuckling to each other. Oh dear. “O ek wil huis toe gaan!” tweeted @capeafricatours And just like that Kurt Darren completely butchers the National Anthem!

Mans was still in tune to Kaptein” said @TP_Pillay@Michelle_Igwe added: “This Dorp is so small. The stadium is across the river from me. I always wondered what all the noise was about but never bothered to find out. Then Twitter told me Kurt Darren murdered the National Anthem. That’s how I found out about the Varsity Cup” When you thought Ras Dumisani reached the highest point in comes Kurt Darren in a hold my beer dude spirit. Kurt Darren just did a Ras Dumisani and butcher the national anthem at the @FNBVarsityCup finals on live TV!!!! #ssrugby @varsitycupIOL SportLike IOL Sport on Facebook Follow IOL Sport on TwitterTrending on IOLMale runner, 35, dies during Two Oceans MarathonBLF ad aimed at Zuma supporters, says expertDurban's five most loved businesses namedPICS: Police and SPCA raid Durban dog house of horrorWestern Cape ranked best-run province in South AfricaSign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles.
