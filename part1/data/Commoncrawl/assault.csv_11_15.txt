He said the allegation from residents who contacted the county involves a deliberate scheme to impact the electionNon-members of the group took control of town offices in the sister city of Hildale, Utah, in the 2017 elections. The towns are separate municipalities separated only by the Utah-Arizona state line in the middle of town.Both cities are being closely watched by court-appointed monitors after they were found guilty of civil rights violations against non-members. The group's leader, Warren Jeffs, is serving a life sentence for sexually assaulting underage girls he considered brides.Government-ordered evictions have taken away hundreds of homes from FLDS members who refuse to pay property taxes and $100-a-month occupancy fees due to their religious beliefs."It is such a complex situation up there that I think it only behooves us to make the decision to help clarify exactly what happened," county board member Gary Watson said during the meeting on funding.Former Bullhead City detective Gary Engels will be hired to handle the case that will probably take a couple of months, Smith said."It will put people on notice, if in fact there is inappropriate conduct going on," Smith said.Christine Katas, who lives in the community and runs a nonprofit to help the FLDS, said the investigation is politically motivated based on myths about a targeted group that is treated poorly because their religion is unpopular.Katas said FLDS members tried their best to comply with voter laws."These people did not want to commit fraud," Katas said.
