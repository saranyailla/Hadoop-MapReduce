News Corp is a network of leading companies in the worlds of diversified media, news, education, and information services.The glamorous couple met a string of women at bars before drugging and sexually assaulting them, prosecutors sayA US surgeon who appeared in a reality TV dating show 'Online Dating Rituals of the American Male' and his girlfriend have been charged with drugging and sexually assaulting seven women.Grant Robicheaux, 38, and Cerissa Laura Riley, 31, have denied all accusations of nonconsensual sex. Here's everything we know about the case so far.Dr Grant Robicheaux is a California surgeon specialising in orthopaedics and a one-time American reality TV personality.The handsome surgeon was dubbed "Orange County's Most Eligible Bachelor" in 2013.Cerissa Riley is a dance instructor who moved in with Robicheaux in Newport Beach, 45 miles south of Los Angeles, last year.According to her former husband, she's a devout Christian.In September 2018, the pair were arrested and initially charged with drugging and sexually assaulting two women in 2016.After the charges were made public, more than a dozen women came forward with similar accusations, reports the New York Post.Prosecutors later added criminal charges related to an additional five alleged sexual assault victims.Videos of other potential victims were on the defendants' phones, prosecutors claimed initially.In November, the DA's office said they "never said all the images are incriminating, sexual in nature, or show incapacitation or intoxication."The DA's statement added: "This case is not about the video evidence; it is about the seven women who bravely came forward to report their assaults."Authorities allege the pair drugged and sexually assaulted women they met at social events in Southern California.Once the women were intoxicated, the couple brought them back to Robicheaux's home and sexually assaulted them, according to officials.Robicheaux and Riley have been charged with 17 felony counts, including five counts of rape - which the couple have denied.They have also been charged with possession of cocaine, ecstasy and the drug DBH (Dopamine Beta-Hydroxylase).In September last year, then Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas alleged that videos seized during the investigation showed women who "appear to be highly intoxicated beyond the ability to consent or resist, and they're barely responsive to the defendant's sexual advances."Based on this evidence, we believe that there might be many unidentified victims out there."He added: "We believe the defendants used their good looks and charm to lower the inhibitions of their potential prey."Investigators said the pair worked "in tandem" to meet women at bars, drug them or force them to drink large amounts of alcohol, and then bring them back to Robicheaux's apartment to be assaulted."Women who have encountered these two might have felt a false sense of security due to the fact that both defendants are clean cut, good-looking," Mr Rackauckas said."We tend to trust doctors who take an oath to do no harm."The second defendant, being a female, is key."A woman purporting to be his girlfriend clearly played a significant role in disarming the victims, making them feel comfortable and safe," he said.Other charges against the two allege large amounts of illegal drugs were found in Robicheaux's residence in January 2018.Robicheaux is also accused of possessing two illegal, unregistered assault rifles, four other firearms and magazines capable of carrying large amounts of ammunition.The district attorney said the state's medical board has opened an investigation into the surgeon, but there is no evidence so far that any of his patients could be victims.Both appeared in court last October on charges spanning from 2009 to 2018, and were released on $1 million bail.If convicted, Robicheaux and Riley could spend 40 years and 30 years in prison respectively.Attorneys for the pair issued a statement saying: "All allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Grant Robicheaux and his girlfriend Cerissa Riley."In a statement, the couple said last October that they had "great friends, great lives and great careers" before being arrested, and that they "look forward to getting our lives back."In January, the couple's lawyers accused prosecutors of making false and reckless public misstatements regarding videos that allegedly depicted the pair of having sex with intoxicated women.Then, in March, an Orange County Superior Court judge agreed to a woman's request to pause her civil lawsuit against the surgeon, according to the Los Angeles Times.She had asked Judge Walter Schwarm to stay proceedings in the suit until Robicheaux's criminal case has gone through court proceedings.Prosecutors allege the couple drugged her drink with GHB at a party in 2016, and that she was raped in the bedroom of their Newport Beach home.The plaintiff is claiming $12.2 million in damages, and had filed her lawsuit last year to beat a filing deadline under the statute of limitations, the Los Angeles Times explained. Robicheaux once appeared on the Bravo cable network's reality TV show Online Dating Rituals Of The American Male.The series first aired on Sunday, March 9, 2014, before moving to its regular time slot on Thursday, March 13, 2014.The show, which ran for one series, followed several men who were looking for everything from a one-night stand to their future wives via the internet.We pay for your stories!
